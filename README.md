## After cloning:

Install 2 dependencies: `requests` and `bs4`. You can do this by running `pip install requests` and `pip install bs4` in a command-line.

Then, run the file `main.py` using the command `python main.py` to run the program.

If you'd like to change the initial link that the web scraper starts with, please edit the `main.py` file and change the link assigned to `initialLink` to the link you want to scrape. Keep in mind, this link should contain `https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies`.

It consolidated 14 such businesses situated in South Africa and in Mozambique.By 2000, Reclam achieved a leading position in the recycled ferrous and non-ferrous metals markets, expanding its operations by diversifying into other products that could benefit from similar economies of scale and operating efficiencies. This included:\nIn 2000, Reclam identified growth opportunities in Southern Africa and established operations in Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.In 2003, Reclam concluded its first Black Economic Empowerment (\u201cBEE\u201d) transaction pursuant to which 25% plus one share of the equity was sold to Phamangu Investment Holdings in a transaction partly funded by the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa.During 2005, the Company expanded its business into semi-finished products as part of the strategy to add value to its wide range of recycled products it produces. These included aluminium ingots in partnership with Murray & Roberts Limited, and copper sulphate, integral to the refining of platinum.Effective 1 February 2006, in terms of a management buyout, The New Reclamation Group (Proprietary) Limited (\u201cReclam Group\u201d) was formed to acquire the business and all of the assets of Reclam. In order to facilitate this buyout, Reclam Group issued a high-yield bond, which is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, to a broad range of prominent European investors.Subsequent to the buyout, Reclam Group concluded a further empowerment transaction in 2008. Reclam Group\u2019s empowerment partners are part of a consortium which holds a 25% stake in Scaw Metals,a division of Anglo Operation Limited.Today, Reclam\u2019s business can be considered as \u201cabove-the-ground\u201d mining. Reclam beneficiates basic commodities that are sold to the same customer base as that of the mines.

Clack Soft Water eventually grew into a small Wisconsin dealer network featuring the Golden Seahorse brand.By 1960, Clack Soft Water had evolved into a manufacturing and distributing company serving independent OEM assemblers. During the 1960s, Clack designed and manufactured several brass control valves including the 609, which was a five-cycle, fully automatic valve, the only plastic part being the injector. Clack also improved corrosion resistance of raw steel tanks by using epoxy liners and over-painting enamel for use in manufacturing side mount filter and softener tanks.\u00a0 Clack Corporation\u2019s primary activity was distributing Ionac C249 resin, Erie control valves, Apex fiberglass mineral tanks, as well as manufacturing various components such as 369 Manumatic valves, brine valves, and iron removal medias such as BIRM\u00ae.From 1969 through the mid 1970\u2019s, Clack participated in a joint venture in Belgium with Erie Controls, with Clack responsible for manufacturing Apex-style mineral tanks. Because of the 1974 oil crisis, Clack began manufacturing blow molded brine tanks by 1975. Clack Corporation later formed a joint venture in Belgium with Structural Fibers, distributing Clack products as well as manufacturing Structural FRP tanks.Richard Clack joined the company on a full time basis in 1970, after graduating from the University of Wisconsin. Rich was responsible for the growth of the blow molding components division during the late 1970s, creating a complete line of brine tanks and specialized custom blow molding that included three production facilities. The complete line of manufactured brine tanks allowed Clack to consolidate components to OEMs in a very competitive package, reducing customer inventory and increasing their product turns.In the early 1980s, Clack started molding proprietary plastic water treatment components and assembling filter cartridges in Rogers, Arkansas. The 1980s included the learning curve conversions from brass parts to engineered plastics. Clack introduced the Microline RO system using a patented proprietary designed manifold plate that took advantage of previous plastic molding experiences.Rich became president and CEO of Clack on the passing of his father Bill in 1987. In the 1990s, Clack continued to grow plastic custom blow molding as well as greatly improving the distribution of water treatment components to customers worldwide. Because of industry consolidation and market conditions, Clack designed and introduced a completely new electronic 1 inch engineered plastic control valve in 2000, taking advantage of multiple customer focus groups and utilizing its past plastic molding knowledge of water treatment pressurized components. In the following nine years, Clack completed its line of residential and commercial control valves up to 3 inch service flow.

In 1961, our founder, Jack Berg, saw a need in the surface finishing industry for better filtration to improve plating quality and reduce rejects. Armed with only the experience gained as a manufacturer\u2019s representative selling filters to platers and a desire to be in business for himself, he took the plunge and opened a small storefront business selling pumps, filter chambers and filter cartridges.\nFrom that humble beginning, SERFILCO has grown to become a multi-national manufacturer of a wide range of filtration and liquid handling products serving many industries. With five plants in North America as well as operations in England, France and Germany, plus a worldwide network of sales representatives, we are strategically positioned to supply the needs of our customers.\nOver the past four decades, we\u2019ve seen many changes in the field of metal finishing and process industries. As these changes were taking place, equipment was also changing. Newer and better designs, along with a broader array of chemically resistant materials are being used to provide the tools needed to operate more effectively and efficiently, as well as with greater safety for workers and the environment.\nSERFILCO Pumps, Filters, Chambers and Filtration Systems takes pride in its role in bringing many of these advances to the marketplace. Magnetically coupled pumps, vertical pumps, externally mounted single and double mechanical seal pumps, all-plastic filtration systems, and pumped agitation systems using eductors to agitate process and cleaning solutions all can be tracked back to the foresight, ingenuity and perseverance of SERFILCO people.\nFor us, the end of the last millennium was a learning period during which time we accumulated a generation of experience in meeting needs and solving problems with products that are the benchmark of the industry.\nToday, at the start of the new millennium, we are looking forward to the future with the expectation that we will continue to be a technical resource, contributing to the growth and satisfaction of our customers and their needs including our Serfilco Pumps, Filter Chambers, Filtration Systems, Filtration Media, Pump Accessories and Replacement Parts for Pumps."}]}]

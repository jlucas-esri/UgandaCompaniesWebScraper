When the company was first founded it was a light metals foundry, which soon became one of Swedens largest. The founder and president, W. Dan Bergman lent his initials to the company name. These days Weda manufactures various types of underwater cleaning equipment. Read more about our rich history below:\n1919Aluminiumfoundry started by Mr. W. Dan Bergman in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Sweden. Production of household items.\n1939The company has grown into an aluminum and magnesium foundry. Production of military goods and parts for airplanes. Major customer \u2013 Bofors AB.\n1943WEDA, acquired by Bofors AB three years earlier, now has a Swedish pump manufacturer as customer - Flygt.\n1957Flygt starts it\u2019s own foundry. Weda introduces it\u2019s own brand of submersible pumps - the Weda pump.\n1969WEDA employs 700 people making WEDA the biggest employer in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje.\n1975The company introduces it\u2019s first swimming pool cleaner \u2013 a pump with a brush and rod attached to it.\n1981Weda introduces it\u2019s first automatic pool cleaner \u2013 the B600.\n1986Introduction of the B400 series of automatic pool cleaners.\n1992Production of pumps ends.\n1994Weda is asked to help the Stockholm water company develop a machine for cleaning sedimentation basins. Development of the SD System sludge collector begins.\n1995WEDA Poolcleaner ISO 9001 certified.\n1996The first installation of six Weda SD System sludge collector systems at the Lov\u00f6 water works in Stockholm, Sweden. The VR-600 for on-line cleaning of water reservoirs is introduced.\n1997Weda is acquired by the Eletta group.\n2000Trials start with the YT-800 machine for cleaning slow sand filters. Again, the target is to avoid emptying the basins.\n2002The B680 automatic pool cleaner is introduced featuring a new filter system and an ergonomic handle which makes handling of the robot much easier.\n2004Weda becomes sole supplier of cleaners at the Olympic Game in Athens.\n2005Several Weda VR-600\u00b4s are delivered to Service Provider around the world. SD installations are made on several markets.\n2007Weda becomes a privately owned corporation. First orders from Veolia, Vodokanal and other major water companies around the world.\n2010New installations are continuously made in various industrial basins. A special cleaner is developed in cooperation with Westinghouse Service for cleaning in nuclear power stations.\n2018The product portfolio from Weda now offers solutions for sediment removal in basically all types of tanks and reservoirs. Lack of water around the world, increased demands on water producers and industries, along with improved public awareness of the importance of clean water has assisted in the continued growth of Weda products.

At the same time Weda aims to save energy and minimize the use of chemicals for its clients. Fresh water must be treated with care. We have limited resources in the world. Weda has become a creator of solutions for several clients around the world who has designed and built pools, water tanks and reservoirs. When they later put into use, it has proved that it often has not been so easy to clean and maintain. In cooperation with clients and partners like Veolia, Westinghouse and Stockholm Water Weda has developed cleaning robots for specific applications. Examples are water reservoirs, cooling towers and nuclear power plants. Public pools is still a major market for Weda. With a complete range of cleaners for public pools Weda has positioned itself as a producer of the highest quality cleaners in the world, and with a service network to back it up.\nAll types of sedimentation in water are not dangerous. If not removed however sediment may become a breeding ground for bacteria (E-coli, cryptosporidium, etc). Organic particles left on the bottom of pools in combination with high levels of chlorine may also be the cause of contamination such as cancerous chloramines. To remove the sediment, thereby making a better environment, is in short the purpose with everything we do at Weda. We minimize the waste of water and we assist in minimizing the use of chemicals in all sorts of water bodies."}, {"title": "Industry", "description": "The industrial sector designs and develops underwater cleaning equipment for tanks and reservoirs in industries like Nuclear Power stations, glass works, steel works, pulp and paper facilities etc.\nWeda has delivered and installed cleaners in nuclear power plants, glass factories, fish farms, gypsum plants, pulp and paper mills and several other applications where there is a need for cleaning (sludge removal) without having to drain the water.\nWeda has a unique experience and know-how from more than 50 years activities in the development and production of products for under water use.

This represents a huge mountain of precious natural resources, particularly copper and aluminum. The old way of handling cable scrap was to burn it, in order to get rid of the plastic insulation. This approach has serious harmful effects on nature and human beings. The burning process of PVC is well known to cause serious environmental damages. For example, very toxic hydrochloric acid is often a by-product when PVC is burnt and comes in contact with water. Burning of cable scrap is today prohibited by governments in almost every country.

The company manufacture a range of environmental water treatment devices under the trademarks of ScaleBuster and ISB. Over the past years our technology has been installed by many well-known global companies with excellent results. Our products have been applied into more than 300,000 applications to date.Environmental issues are adding extra costs in many process industries, profits are down and images are affected. This situation is forcing industry to change its habits. Sustainable technologies, such as ScaleBuster, are seeing increased investment from Global, European and North American Companies as business culture adapts. The technology developed in the United Kingdom has had more than US$8.5m (\u00a36m) invested for its launch into North American cooling system applications marketed under the brand EnviroTower TM.We seek global business partners, OEM supply, Distributors, Licensees and marketing organisations to penetrate various worldwide markets with our patented ScaleBuster technology.About the technologyThe patented ScaleBuster technology can completely replace traditional chemical treatment of certain cooling systems; providing control of scale and corrosion in various water process systems to create an exceptionally clean system. This dramatically reduces energy and water consumption, while reducing or, in certain cases, eliminating toxic water discharge to the environment.How does it work?Once the ISB is installed into the system the calcium and magnesium are precipitated into suspension. These particles remain within the flow of the water. When these particles reach the hot parts of the system the tendency to adhere to the hot surfaces is dramatically reduced. Therefore the ScaleBuster protects the equipment from potential limestone damage. The ISB is conceived to make the particles formed non-adherent. After installation of the ISB, limestone is mainly present in the form of aragonite, which is a non-adherent crystalline structure contrary to the untreated calcite that can cause deterioration and damage in unprotected systems."}, {"title": "About ION Enterprises", "description": "A Pioneer in Green Corrosion & Scale Inhibiting Technology\nFounded in 1990 in England, ION Enterprises manufacturers a range of environmental water treatment devices under the trademark ION ScaleBuster\u00ae.

The patented, electrostatic device operates without electrical power and has no moving components. The electrostatic device uses the dielectric characteristics of the special plastics and metallic materials of its construction combined with the hydraulic conditions present during operation to force the precipitation of solid crystals in the water. This reduces the likelihood of scale and corrosion from forming and conditions the water to absorb scale already attached to internal equipment surfaces.The range of applications to which ScaleBuster can be used is extensive. Experience since 1994 with this technology shows that the fundamental requirements vary depending on water systems, system layout and equipment to be protected. The requirements will also vary depending on whether the product is for new construction or refurbishment of an existing system. newterra has established a family of products to cover the range of installations from individual appliance protection and building usage through to large heavy industrial process applications.\nCustomer Benefits\n"}, {"title": "key words", "description": "water physical sacrificial Zinc anode galvanic electro static electrostatic conditioning conditioner treater treatment corrosion scale build up scaling prevention corrosion-free scle-free ScaleBuster ScaleBuster ScaleBuster ISB scalemaster scaleblaster scalebaster scalebster"}]}, {"name": "Metrohm AG", "description": "Metrohm is a worldwide leading manufacturer of precision instruments for chemical analysis.

At first, he manufactured door locks, door handles, nameplates and sculptures for grave sites. After the First World War, Hermann Sewerin produced milk centrifuges ('G\u00fctersloh Sahna') and carburettors for cars and motorcycles ('Einhorn').Together with his brother Fritz, Hermann Sewerin manufactured a tobacco pipe called 'Sewerin's Vulkan (Volcano)', developed and patented by another of his brothers, Wilhelm. Hermann Sewerin established Vulkan-Werk GmbH to manufacture these pipes. The company was entered in the commercial register on 9 October 1923.The frequent mining disasters that took place at that time inspired Hermann Sewerin to develop a 'gas indicator for indicating mine gases'. The Reichspatentamt (State Patent Office) granted a patent for the gas indicator on 8 October 1931. This invention laid the foundation for the significance the company enjoys today. The 2nd generation - from trade production to industrial operation \u2026The company founder's three sons, Paul, Heinz and Willy Sewerin, joined the company in the early 1930s. In 1933 Paul Sewerin carried out the first systematic examination of a gas pipeline network by order of the Fulda Municipal Gas and Waterworks. The name 'Sewerin' became well known among gasworks. For this reason, on 30 December 1936, Vulkan-Werk GmbH became the Hermann Sewerin Company.When Hermann Sewerin died suddenly in 1941, his three sons continued to run the company. After the Second World War it developed from a trade production operation into an industrial company. The range of devices and services offered primarily to utility supply companies continued to expand as the years went by.The 3rd generation - innovation and change \u2026From the mid-1960s to the 1970s, the third generation joined the company: Peter Sewerin, the son of Willy Sewerin, and Hermann Sewerin, the son of Heinz Sewerin (\u20201975). Paul Sewerin died in 1980.When the company moved in 1991 to its new location on Robert-Bosch-Stra\u00dfe, not only was its appearance rejuvenated, but its organization was realigned with respect to the requirements of the next millennium. In 1998, after more than 60 years of service, Willy Sewerin retired.The 4th generation - globalisation and new markets ...The rapidly growing Chinese market has definitely opened and Sewerin has positioned itself in the 'Middle Kingdom' as a proven partner for gas and water suppliers. Dr. Swen Hermann Sewerin \u2013 son of Peter Sewerin and grandson of Willy Sewerin \u2013 has been with the company since July 2001 and became its CEO in August 2004. With the entr\u00e9e of the 4th generation, the continuity of this family run company is assured."}, {"title": "Certificates", "description": ""}]}, {"name": "The Baker Company", "description": "For nearly 70 years The Baker Company has been at the forefront of engineering, testing and production of reliable laboratory contamination control equipment.

The first real landfill compactor with two full-width iron drums was manufactured for an exhibition in Hanover, Germany, in 1971. The unit was sold and delivered to a German customer and so Tana's first step towards becoming a global waste management business was taken. 1971 is considered to be the year of birth of the company.\nThe landfill compactor was continuously developed. New series kept coming, one after another: S Series, C Series, F Series. The picture above shows a TANA 27C with its proud owners in Spain in the late eighties. Over the years the company name was changed from Tana-Jyr\u00e4 Ltd. to Kone-Jyr\u00e4 Ltd. and finally to Oy Tanacorp Ltd. In 1995, the present owner of the company became involved in the business.\nThat was the start of a complete turnaround in the company and the principle of continuous improvement was adopted. All products except for landfill compactors were given up, the organization and operations of the business were streamlined, new markets were entered into and customer experiences and feedback was gathered and carefully listened to in order to create even better landfill compactors. Product development was carried out in close cooperation with Norwegian customers, the distributor Magne Gitmark & Co. A/S, with whom we still co-operate with today. Eventually, the TANA G Series was born.

Experience AERZEN and use our knowledge -\u00a0Expect Performance!\nAERZEN is an international manufacturer ofPositive Displacement Blowers,Hybrid Blowers,Screw CompressorsandTurbo Blowers. The high-quality machines are used for air and gas applications, for example in waste water treatment, pneumatic conveying of bulk materials and process gas conveying. In addition, AERZEN provides rental blowers quickly and easily.\nYears of experience, continuous technical developments and innovations combined with high internal quality standards have made the mechanical engineering company a world market leader for compressed air technologies. AERZEN stands forquality,engineering,first-class customer serviceandoutstanding product support.\nRight from the start, we work closely with our customers and deal with the industry-specific requirements of our technologies. We develop products and solutions according to realistic conditions, which not only satisfy the needs, but often exceed them. The variety of designs and serial customisation possibilities of our products are therefore almost unrivalled. This diversity, combined with the precise knowledge of the operational areas of our application specialists, enables us to develop plant concepts together with our customers that fully meet the requirements in terms of energy efficiency, longevity, reliability and expandability.\nAERZEN compressors have become indispensable in the American waste water industry. The machines are used especially for the ventilation of aeration tanks in wastewater treatment plants. This process step is the most energy-intensive of the entire waste water treatment process and holds a lot of potential for savings. That is why AERZEN has developed especially efficient and innovative concepts for its customers in the field of wastewater treatment. One of these, for example, is Performance\u00b3, in which\u00a0different compressor technologies are switched precisely along the load curve.\nThe compressed air requirement in wastewater treatment plants varies according to the time of day and the season: More compressed air is required during the day than at night. In summer the water demand of a place is generally higher than in winter. In order to avoid a waste of energy by a continuous use of all machines, the blowers are always used which can generate the currently required compressed air in the most energy-saving way. This ensures that only as much compressed air as necessary is generated in any given case. Overproduction and the associated waste of energy are avoided. The machines are switched on, off and on with the aid of intelligent machine controls, such as the AERsmart control system.\nAERZEN offers its customers a special service, the AERaudit, to improve the energy efficiency of existing plants. This makes it possible to check the energy saving potential of a system. In this way, technical improvements can be implemented in close cooperation with the customer, which usually pay for themselves very quickly.\nCustomers can also benefit from the expertise of the compressed air specialist in the field of pneumatic conveying. Pneumatic conveying of bulk materials or dusts is mainly required in the food, pharmaceutical or construction materials industries. Positive displacement blowers, screw compressors or turbo blowers generate a compressed air stream or negative pressure through which dusts or light goods such as flour are transported to the next production step. AERZEN guarantees\u00a0100% purity of the transported goods\u00a0due to its\u00a0absorbent and oil-free compressed air technology.\nIn addition to cleanliness, safety is a major factor in pneumatic conveying. Especially in petrochemical applications it is important to integrate explosion-proof processes. AERZEN has also developed appropriate solutions for this which, in addition to the known advantages, also have ATEX certification.\nThe possibilities of pneumatic conveying in industry are manifold:\nTurbo blowers or screw compressors, for example, ensure a reliable supply of flour in milling companies, generate the necessary negative pressure for the extraction systems for coal dust in lignite-fired power plants, or suck off the finest metal particles produced during the punching of sheet metal and return them to the production cycle.\nAERZEN solves even the most demanding individual application requirements.

The unit was sold and delivered to a German customer and so Tana's first step towards becoming a global waste management business was taken. 1971 is considered to be the year of birth of the company.\nThe landfill compactor was continuously developed. New series kept coming, one after another: S Series, C Series, F Series. The picture above shows a TANA 27C with its proud owners in Spain in the late eighties. Over the years the company name was changed from Tana-Jyr\u00e4 Ltd. to Kone-Jyr\u00e4 Ltd. and finally to Oy Tanacorp Ltd. In 1995, the present owner of the company became involved in the business.\nThat was the start of a complete turnaround in the company and the principle of continuous improvement was adopted. All products except for landfill compactors were given up, the organization and operations of the business were streamlined, new markets were entered into and customer experiences and feedback was gathered and carefully listened to in order to create even better landfill compactors. Product development was carried out in close cooperation with Norwegian customers, the distributor Magne Gitmark & Co. A/S, with whom we still co-operate with today.

Electropure licensed its electrodeionization technology to Glegg Water in 1994, enabling Robert Glegg to develop E-Cell\u00ae, now Suez Water\u2019s EDI technology.\nContinued innovation\nIn 1998 Electropure finished development and patented its Excellion\u2122 ion exchange membranes and process, which enabled the XL\u2122 product line to be developed in 1999.\nThe next step\n2004 marked the introduction of the Electropure XL-HTS\u2122 (High Temperature Stable) electrodeionization product line. SnowPure\u2019s product line expanded again in 2005 with the introduction of Zapwater\u2122 EDI for laboratories. SnowPure, a private corporation, was formed in 2005 and via a management buyout acquired Electropure\u2019s EDI division. In 2006, SnowPure embarked on an aggressive expansion in China, opening up its sales office in Shanghai.\nCelebrating our past, building our future\nIn 2007, SnowPure launched the XL-R industrial EDI product line. SnowPure International was formed in Hong Kong in 2008. The next year was highlighted by the addition of a revolutionary low-energy, compact UV product to the SnowPure line. In 2011, SnowPure launched the EXL\u2122\u00a0EDI series worldwide and opened a global production and logistics facility in China.\nWe are actively working to add technologies that make electrodeionization work better, for example for hemodialysis water, and reducing silica further for semiconductor and power generation. An example is the new ExcellPure\u2122 RO, the highest silica rejection membrane available.\nSnowPure continues to create new innovations while expanding its world market presence in the pure water industry."}, {"title": "SnowPure Applications:", "description": "SnowPure is a global leader in high-technology water products.

To do this, we improve the efficiency of the processes or adapt the processes to new tasks, for example tasks which we are set by our customers or which arise through statutory regulations.\nHere, the focus is constantly on diverse anaerobic technology applications as well as various bio-film processes, for example using Biomar\u00ae biological treatment processes.  In the field of Envochem\u00ae chemical-physical treatment processes, we are constantly working on the formulations of our water treatment products. Important topics here are the improvement of efficiency, the environmental impact and the development of formulations for new applications. All of our product ranges are continuously evaluated according to many different criteria, for example to improve flow conditions or the behaviour of membranes. Here we attach particular importance to cost-effectiveness, but also take account of energy and cleaning efficiency or process stability, as well as the robustness of the processes, for example.\nDissolved-air flotation optimised for water circulation systems\nThe injector system for dissolved-air plants, which has been newly developed by EnviroChemie, makes it possible to save operating costs because it is no longer mandatory for the cleaning results and the operation of the flotation plant to condition the water with chemicals.\nThe company has received German utility model protection for its specific dissolved-air flotation system from the Flomar\u00ae series. This modified version is, for example, suited to depleting the solids from highly polluted exhaust air purification wash cycles from washing towers or electrostatic precipitators. The task here is to reduce the pollutants from the cycles without substantial usage of salt and to thereby keep costs down. Complete clarification of the wastewater is not necessary.\nTraditional dissolved-air flotation systems produce the flotation motive water through air saturation of a partial flow in the plant outflow. The saturation usually takes place using multi-stage pumps, which only run smoothly if they are fed with pH-neutral wastewater that is mostly free from solids.\nThe injector system developed by EnviroChemie achieves micro-bubble formation comparable to saturation by pumps. The air saturation of the partial flow is carried out by an injector pressure container, which is fed by a wastewater pump resistant to solids. A multi-stage pump is then no longer required for the operation of the flotation. Both alkaline and acidic wastewater can be treated easily with the new system. As a result, cycles can be treated with the flotation plants without chemical conditioning or neutralisation. The flocculant dosage is only required to produce separable flocs. If floatable solids are also present without flocculation, a chemical-free procedure is possible.\nWe are continuously developing our processes for industrial water treatment\nUsing our own process technology laboratory with attached technology centre, we continuously develop our processes for water treatment, water recycling and wastewater treatment.\nWe develop new plants or further develop existing plants, within the framework of customer orders or the development of our own plants.\nIn our water chemistry lab, we test the efficiency of new high-performance chemicals in various fields of application. On behalf of our customers, we determine the optimum composition of water treatment chemicals for their treatment processes, then mix them according to recipe and supply the goods.\nNew Patent\nEnviroChemie Awarded Patent to Process for Extraction of Aluminium from Suds\nWorking within the scope of the research strategy \u201cReclamation and Recycling of Reusable Materials from Industrial Production Cycles and Wastewater\u201d, the EnviroChemie researchers have developed a process for the extraction of aluminium from suds. The primary objective of the research project was to find an economic process which could be used to extract aluminium in different concentrations from strongly alkaline suds and to enable re-use of the suds.\nThe addition of aluminium to the strongly alkaline suds reduces the service life of the suds and they become unusable over the course of time. The newly developed processed is based on converting the aluminium into a solid form (so-called zeolite precipitation) by adding soluble glass (alkali silicates) to the suds. The precipitates are separated from the suds by means of membrane filtration system with a cross-flow method. The recycling of the suds can function as a continuous process so that the operation of the operation bath does not have to be interrupted.\nAs Dr Engelhart, Head of Research and Development at EnviroChemie, reports, the process has already proved to be successful for the processing of suds used for cleaning bottles in the beverage industry.\n>> Patent Certificate\nNew plant solutions\nReduce operating costs for wastewater treatment by using Biomar Ecomizer technology\nBiogas, which consists mainly of methane and carbon dioxide, is generated during the anaerobic treatment of wastewater. A part of the carbon dioxide which is created dissolves into the wastewater in the anaerobic reactor, and the carbonic acid this creates leads to a fall in the pH value. As an alternative to using chemicals for the neutralisation required, EnviroChemie successfully installs its Biomar Ecomizer technology.\u00a0 The operating costs of the anaerobic system are significantly reduced. Payback periods of just a few years can be demonstrated for this process, due to the savings on caustic soda.\nWe have already installed Biomar Ecomizer technology in a number of wastewater treatment plants for Baltika, one of the largest brewery groups in Russia. Tests at a large wine making cooperative in Germany have shown that the installation of the technology can also be of benefit there.\nElectroflotation E-Flo-Dr. Baer expands the range of processes on offer\nWe have incorporated electroflotation technology into our range of plants, using the product name E-Flo-Dr. Baer. With over 40 years of experience in this specialised technology, Dr. Baer Verfahrenstechnik provides a mature process. The technology has been integrated into the system series of EnviroChemie products for water treatment, water recycling, and wastewater treatment, giving access to models that have proven themselves hundreds of times, in the field of measurement and control technology as well as pumps and drive technology.\nThis specialised electroflotation product complements the well-established Flomar\u00ae series of dissolved-air flotations. While investment costs are always higher compared to dissolved-air flotation, it can be used without any restrictions for water temperatures in excess of 80\u00b0 C, and barely creates any foam. The precise separation of the flotate ensures a high degree of cleansing, eliminating the need for further filter stages. This makes E-Flo-Dr. Baer electroflotation especially suitable for the cleaning and treatment of water circulation systems.\nEnviModul - flexible plant solutions for water and wastewater technology\nDecentralised water and wastewater technology is in demand worldwide. EnviModul modular plant systems make it possible for water and wastewater treatment plants to be assembled in a flexible manner. Compared with classic, centralised solutions in mixed structures, modular decentralised plant solutions offer advantages when it comes to costs, flexibility and speed of implementation. We have developed the independent, modular EnviModul system as part of a BlueCompetence product development program."}]}, {"name": "ProMinent GmbH", "description": "The ProMinent group of companies is based in Heidelberg and for over 55 years has been developing and manufacturing components and systems for metering liquids and solutions for water treatment and water disinfection.

OPSIS\u2019 first focus area was gas detection in ambient air using a novel open-path technology called DOAS. It soon evolved to use the same technology also in industrial applications such as emissions monitoring in power plants and for process control in production facilities. Other types of gaseous and particulate detectors as well as other application-specific sensors were also added to the product portfolio, resulting in today\u2019s wide range of environmental monitoring equipment and related products and services.  Presently, OPSIS has about half of its business in the AQM field, and half of it in the CEM/process control field. The central monitoring equipment is almost always a DOAS analyser, operating either in the ultraviolet (UV) or the infrared (IR) wavelength region. The analyser is combined with other types of sensors and communication solutions, resulting in a complete environmental monitoring system.  A typical OPSIS system for AQM consists of a UV DOAS gas analyser, a beta attenuation dust monitor\u00a0and a set of meteorological sensors, monitoring local air quality. Multiple AQM systems are often combined in networks allowing full surveillance of the air in larger regions. The measurement results are usually forwarded to data management systems\u00a0over the Internet. This allows for real-time presentation of air quality as well as statistical analysis and air quality studies that can help improve the quality of the air we breathe.  A typical CEM/process control system consists of one or two DOAS analysers (UV\u00a0+ FTIR) for measurements of gas concentrations, in combination with other instruments providing e.g. flue gas flow rates and dust concentrations. The measurement results are often forwarded in real time to the process control system using any of the standard industrial communication protocols supported. From there, the results can be used for e.g. emissions monitoring and process optimization.  OPSIS\u2019 environmental monitoring systems have been tested and approved\u00a0by a number of internationally recognized institutes and authorities.  OPSIS\u2019 environmental monitoring systems are characterized by their reliability, durability and low maintenance costs; numerous references will vouch for this."}]}, {"name": "Anguil Environmental Systems, Inc.", "description": "Anguil Environmental Systems, Inc. is an environmental technology supplier headquartered in Milwaukee, WI USA with an extensive global presence, including offices in Asia and Europe.

Natural sources of mercury to air include the oceans, land, biomass burning and volcanoes.\u00a0 Since mercury is an element and cannot be destroyed, one big challenge for mercury scientists is to understand how much of mercury in the environment is due to anthropogenic sources.\u00a0 The major categories of anthropogenic sources of mercury to air are fossil fuel combustion (mainly coal), metal production, industrial and artisanal gold production, cement production, chlor-alkali industry and waste incineration.\u00a0 Annual average anthropogenic mercury emissions to air are estimated to be approximately 2000 tonnes (2000 megagrams/year), but may be up to nearly 3000 tones.\u00a0 Annual average natural emissions to air are estimated to be at least 2000 tonnes with the higher end estimates over 5000 tonnes.\nThe toxicity of mercury is largely dependent on the chemical form and the path of exposure. The most toxic form for dietary intake is methylmercury [CH3Hg]. Exposure of animals to methylmercury affects the immune system, alters genetic and enzyme systems, and damages the nervous system. Methylmercury is also a teratogen, which means it is particularly damaging to developing embryos, which are 5 to 10 times more sensitive than adults.\u00a0 The most toxic form for exposure through inhalation is elemental mercury (Hg0).\u00a0 At sufficient levels, continued inhalation exposure to elemental mercury causes tremors, gingivitis, and excitability.\u00a0 At very high levels, inhalation of elemental mercury can cause death.\u00a0 High levels of elemental mercury are usually confined to industrial settings or mercury spill events.\u00a0 Since elemental mercury is difficult to absorb in the digestive system, there is minimal effect from dietary intake.\nOnce present in aquatic ecosystems, elemental and inorganic mercury can undergo chemical transformations to methylated mercury species and enter the food web.\u00a0 Because methylmercury is not easily purged from organisms, biomagnification of up to 107 can occur in the aquatic food chain.\u00a0 Harm to upper level predators such as birds, sea mammals and humans can result when consuming tissues with high levels of methyl mercury (mainly fish).\u00a0 Acute exposure to high levels of methyl mercury contamination has been well documented in cases such as Minamata Bay, Japan in the 1950\u2019s and Iraq in the 1970s.\u00a0 Recent low-level exposure studies have been used to set government guidelines for methyl mercury consumption nationally and internationally.\u00a0 New studies also suggest that methyl mercury concentrations in rice are a potential concern.\nConsiderable effort has been spent trying to understand how mercury cycles through the environment.\u00a0 A major advancement in understanding began in the early 1990s when scientists began using new ultra-trace level mercury detection instruments, speciation methods and ultra-clean sampling techniques. Ice and sediment core records indicate that environmental mercury levels have increased substantially over pre-industrial levels. \u00a0Direct release of mercury to aquatic ecosystems has been dramatically reduced in Europe and North America, but continues to be an area of concern for emerging and developing countries.\u00a0 However, research has shown that atmospheric emission, dispersal, transformation and subsequent wet and dry deposition is the primary route for mercury contamination in remote aquatic ecosystems far removed from direct sources of contamination. The best control strategy to prevent biomagnification is to limit mercury releases to the environment. While not practical to control natural sources such as volcanoes and geological deposits, it is possible to control anthropogenic releases from activities such as manufacturing, mining, and power production.\u00a0 In the past 10 years, there has been an increased focus on developing mercury control policies and regulations at the national and international level.\u00a0 The increased global emphasis reducing mercury emissions and use provides support new control technology development, new and better monitoring equipment and advance research studies."}]}, {"name": "Flottweg SE", "description": "Flottweg is one of the worldwide leading solution providers in the field of mechanical separation technology.

Since then, we have steadily developed to become a global player. The fact that we have remained a family-owned company has its logic. Reliability, know-how, consulting competence, service, efficiency - these advantages ensure our market success to this day. Our goal is to redefine the quality of our products and application-specific expertise. Experience AERZEN and use our knowledge -\u00a0Expect Performance!\nAERZEN is an international manufacturer ofPositive Displacement Blowers,Hybrid Blowers,Screw CompressorsandTurbo Blowers. The high-quality machines are used for air and gas applications, for example in waste water treatment, pneumatic conveying of bulk materials and process gas conveying. In addition, AERZEN provides rental blowers quickly and easily.\nYears of experience, continuous technical developments and innovations combined with high internal quality standards have made the mechanical engineering company a world market leader for compressed air technologies. AERZEN stands forquality,engineering,first-class customer serviceandoutstanding product support.\nRight from the start, we work closely with our customers and deal with the industry-specific requirements of our technologies. We develop products and solutions according to realistic conditions, which not only satisfy the needs, but often exceed them. The variety of designs and serial customisation possibilities of our products are therefore almost unrivalled. This diversity, combined with the precise knowledge of the operational areas of our application specialists, enables us to develop plant concepts together with our customers that fully meet the requirements in terms of energy efficiency, longevity, reliability and expandability.\nAERZEN compressors have become indispensable in the American waste water industry. The machines are used especially for the ventilation of aeration tanks in wastewater treatment plants. This process step is the most energy-intensive of the entire waste water treatment process and holds a lot of potential for savings. That is why AERZEN has developed especially efficient and innovative concepts for its customers in the field of wastewater treatment. One of these, for example, is Performance\u00b3, in which\u00a0different compressor technologies are switched precisely along the load curve.\nThe compressed air requirement in wastewater treatment plants varies according to the time of day and the season: More compressed air is required during the day than at night. In summer the water demand of a place is generally higher than in winter. In order to avoid a waste of energy by a continuous use of all machines, the blowers are always used which can generate the currently required compressed air in the most energy-saving way. This ensures that only as much compressed air as necessary is generated in any given case. Overproduction and the associated waste of energy are avoided. The machines are switched on, off and on with the aid of intelligent machine controls, such as the AERsmart control system.\nAERZEN offers its customers a special service, the AERaudit, to improve the energy efficiency of existing plants. This makes it possible to check the energy saving potential of a system. In this way, technical improvements can be implemented in close cooperation with the customer, which usually pay for themselves very quickly.\nCustomers can also benefit from the expertise of the compressed air specialist in the field of pneumatic conveying. Pneumatic conveying of bulk materials or dusts is mainly required in the food, pharmaceutical or construction materials industries. Positive displacement blowers, screw compressors or turbo blowers generate a compressed air stream or negative pressure through which dusts or light goods such as flour are transported to the next production step. AERZEN guarantees\u00a0100% purity of the transported goods\u00a0due to its\u00a0absorbent and oil-free compressed air technology.\nIn addition to cleanliness, safety is a major factor in pneumatic conveying. Especially in petrochemical applications it is important to integrate explosion-proof processes. AERZEN has also developed appropriate solutions for this which, in addition to the known advantages, also have ATEX certification.\nThe possibilities of pneumatic conveying in industry are manifold:\nTurbo blowers or screw compressors, for example, ensure a reliable supply of flour in milling companies, generate the necessary negative pressure for the extraction systems for coal dust in lignite-fired power plants, or suck off the finest metal particles produced during the punching of sheet metal and return them to the production cycle.\nAERZEN solves even the most demanding individual application requirements.

As the first global environmental union, it brought together governments and civil society organisations with a shared goal to protect nature. Its aim was to encourage international cooperation and provide scientific knowledge and tools to guide conservation action.\nDuring the first decade of its existence, IUCN\u2019s primary focus was to examine the impact of human activities on nature. It flagged the damaging effects of pesticides on biodiversity, and promoted the use of environmental impact assessments, which have since become the norm across sectors and industries.\nMuch of IUCN\u2019s subsequent work in the 1960s and 1970s was devoted to the protection of species and the habitats necessary for their survival. In 1964, IUCN established the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, which has since evolved into the world\u2019s most comprehensive data source on the global extinction risk of species.\nIUCN also played a fundamental role in the creation of key international conventions, including the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (1971), the World Heritage Convention (1972), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, (1974) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992).\nIn 1980, IUCN \u2013 in partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) \u2013 published the\u00a0World Conservation Strategy, a ground-breaking document which helped define the concept of \u2018sustainable development\u2019 and shaped the global conservation and sustainable development agenda.\nA subsequent version of the strategy,\u00a0Caring for the Earth,\u00a0was published by the three organisations in the run-up to the 1992 Earth Summit. It served as the basis for international environmental policy and guided the creation of the Rio Conventions on biodiversity (CBD), climate change (UNFCCC) and desertification (UNCCD).\nIn 1999, as environmental issues continued to gain importance at the international stage, IUCN was granted official observer status to the United Nations. Today it remains the only environmental organisation with such status.\nIn the early 2000s, IUCN developed its business engagement strategy. Prioritising sectors with a significant impact on nature and livelihoods, such as mining and oil and gas, its aim is to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable.\nLater in the 2000s, IUCN pioneered \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 \u2013 actions to conserve nature which also address global challenges, such as food and water security, climate change and poverty reduction.\nToday, with the expertise and reach of its more than 1,300 Members \u2013 including States, government agencies, NGOs and Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Organisations \u2013 and over 10,000 international experts, IUCN is the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network.

The drone is a learning machine continually collecting data about the environment.\nIt was idea that started some three years ago; but now that idea has landed Capetonian Richard Hardiman in clouded waters. Literally.\nHis concept was to develop a way to clean up harbours and waterways of pollutants, plastics and other debris before nature took its course and shipped it all out to sea on the tide.\u201cHumans are very good at forgetting where waste truly ends up. It if its not going into some landfill somewhere then odds are it has ended up in a storm-water drain, river or outlet and then off into the ocean never to be seen again; by humans that is.\u201d Says Hardiman. \u201cThe impact of plastic soup and these huge plastic islands out in the Pacific ocean and elsewhere cannot be underestimated.\u201dThe entrepreneur\u2019s current project sees him setting up camp in Rotterdam in the Netherlands and developing large autonomous nautical drones that skim the surface of harbors and urban waterways (think canals in Holland\u2019s case) stripping the water of floating plastic bottles, takeaway packets and whatever else has ended up in there to pollute the system.\u201cI am not sure that the idea was born out of being ecologically minded\u201d, says Hardiman, \u201cIt was more of a case of seeing how harbors and marine waste management currently deal with the problem and seeing that there had to be a more effective and efficient way of solving it. The end result of course is a greener planet but to make it sustainable as an idea it needs to parallel good business.\u201dAfter three years of development and trying to find investment into the business, RanMarine, Hardiman\u2019s company, were accepted into the worlds first Port Accelerator, PORTXL, in Holland, based in the port city of Rotterdam. Chosen from some 1700 startups and marine technology businesses globally, Hardiman has now found himself in the middle of Europe\u2019s busiest and largest port building drones and disrupting an industry he for sometime had no idea about.\u201cI always knew the idea made sense from a human element, we all want a greener more sustainable planet and using technology seemed a no-brainer, but to make it a strong business case took a lot of research and time; validating the concept to forever, people love it but as always finding the people who love something and want to pay for it always takes longer.\u201dBut what about competitors?\u201cThey are a number of operations and projects that are cleaning up the oceans and developing amazing technology to bring down the amount of plastic contamination in the water, however much of that is been done in open seas; our intention has always been to trap it at source, tourniquet the pollution before it gets to be a problem out there.\u201dRanMarine\u2019s first foray into the Port\u2019s has started with the WasteShark, an autonomous drone that swims through the water collecting waste while at the same time sending back critical data to the Port authorities on the water quality, weather and depth of the harbor.\u00a0 It\u2019s powered by solar panels and batteries with the ability to learn its environment and become more efficient in its routes and collections.\u201cIt\u2019s Wall-E of water\u201d, says Hardiman referring to the Pixel character of the same name that was left on earth to clean up all of the humanities waste while they escaped in a space ship for greener pastures. \u201cIt is capable of 24-7 operations and is intelligent; it builds knowledge. It doesn\u2019t replace humans and jobs; we still require the same interaction of those that were collecting the waste but our intention is to up-skill workers to operate the Sharks and at the same time collect far more waste.\u201dRanMarine\u2019s journey to Europe is also one of investment and partnering."}]}, {"name": "scan Messtechnik GmbH", "description": "s::can Messtechnik GmbH was established in 1999 as a university spin-off and is based in Vienna, Austria.

Some 60 persons are employed in the company.\nFACILITIES The company is highly integrated and includes the following departments most of which occupy their own individual sites:\nPRODUCTION RANGE The compounding, extrusion moulding, injection moulding and machining of Vesconite and Vesconite Hilube make up most of the production.\nA wide range of standard ready-to-use bushes is also made, while a great variety of custom made finished components are machined from stock and moulded shapes.\nVesconite Hilube was introduced in the late 1980's. It is a further enhancement of the self lubricating properties of Vesconite. Vesconite Hilube is an extra low wear and low friction premium grade.\nVescoPolycap, Vescolene PE and Vescolene PP are produced as extruded rods, as well as moulded and machined.\nOther high performance bearing materials such as Hilube 10, Hilube 20 and Vescoflex are also compounded and moulded for special applications\nAPPLICATIONS VescoPlastics specialises in polymeric materials for bearing applications produced in heavy sections. These materials are designed for many applications where relatively high loads are carried at relatively low speeds, with little or no lubrication, in often dirty or immersed conditions. Custom components include small and large bushes, wear pads and strips, and many parts subject to friction and wear, in many industries including railways, shipping, heavy transport, earth moving, mining, and manufacturing.\nIn summary, VescoPlastics' special formulations and custom components find application in any industry with moving parts where there is a desire for longer life wear parts with the added benefits of less greasing and less maintenance.\nFOREIGN ASSOCIATIONS VescoPlastics has exported its products for over 25 years and the Vesconite trademark has been registered in most parts of the industrialised world, including the United States.\nIt has been the company's policy to expand abroad mainly through independent, well trained distributors fully dedicated to Vesconite. These include:\nThe company also has distributors in Argentina, France, Finland, Greece, Namibia, New Zealand, Zambia and Zimbabwe\nDISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING POLICY The specialised nature of the product range requires that it should be sold on the basis of its cost effectiveness in particular applications. Thus a well informed technical approach, related to the needs of a particular client or market, is generally required for success. This is a general requirement for selling high performance materials. The management devotes much of its time to the study and proposed solutions of such needs.\nThe education of the market and the solution of technical problems in as cost effective a manner as possible have been basic to the growth and success of the company. Coupled with this is an emphasis on client service and fulfilling promised deliveries.\nPROMOTION Promotion by means of the Internet and direct mail aims to inform the engineering and designer community and to encourage enquiries. Such enquiries are carefully studied, recommendations made and prototype trials initiated when the application and the economics appear promising. Use is also made of advertising and editorial engineering publications with a high readership of design engineers.\nMATERIAL ADVANTAGES Vesconite and Vesconite Hilube can claim after over 30 years of extensive usage to offer one of the best all round non-metallic bush and bearing materials, readily available, made of the only modified polymers of their kind, which combine low friction, low wear, self lubrication, good dimensional stability, very low water absorption, suitability for both dry and immersed applications, good load carrying ability, easy machinability - all at greater cost effectiveness than traditional bearing metals.\nPRODUCTION ADVANTAGES VescoPlastics is possibly the only company in the production of engineering plastic materials and finished components which also formulates, develops, compounds and produces its own raw materials.\nThis results in an intimate knowledge of its products and their capabilities and an ability of offer more cost effective solutions. Where an application is of sufficient scope, and requires a bearing material with special characteristics, VescoPlastics will consider the development of a custom formulation.\nCOMPANY ADVANTAGES VescoPlastics' main focus on engineering plastic applications as related to friction and wear problems gives it a great deal of effectiveness in solving existing problems and developing new applications.\nIts technical approach is less concerned with possible short term returns than with the need to satisfy the long term needs of its clients through a cost effective answer to their problems - by providing components and materials that last longer, with little or no greasing."}]}, {"name": "SAMSI PE ta SA Mechanical Seals PE ", "description": "We stock import and export mechanical seals \r\nfor all pumping industries.\r\nDistribute to over 30 countries and locals service and technical support.\r\nWeb Store , for ease of ordering.\r\nUnbeatable stock and Prices\r\nMechanical Seal Refurbishment, Repair Facilty to replace or repair all makes of Mechanical seals.\r\n", "address": "    South Africa", "details": {"Business Type": "Distributor", "Industry Type": "Commercial", "Market Focus": "Globally (various continents)", "Year Founded": "2001", "Employees": "1-10", "Turnover": "less than $1,000,000 US"}, "panels": []}, {"name": "Procon Environmental Technologies (Pty) Ltd.", "description": "Procon Environmetal Technologies (Pty) Ltd. offer a full scope of Environmental Products & Technologies, specializing in systems that minimize the impact of contamination on the environment and surrounding areas.

The goal was to create an international industrial company based on Norwegian natural resources.\nIn 2014, we marked that it was 110 years since Sam Eyde, Knut Tillberg and the Wallenberg brothers met in Stockholm to form Elkem. They aimed to become a major industrial company with an international outlook.\nOver the past 110 years, Elkem has contributed to many pioneering advances within the metallurgical industry that have led to growth and progress for our stakeholders and society at large.\nAt the anniversary in 2004, we commissioned Professor Knut Sogner to write the history of Elkem, resulting in the comprehensive and intriguing book \u00abSkaperkraft\u00bb (Creative Power). The book describes a century of initiative, determination and success, as well as disappointment and even despair.\nIn summary this is a story of a company with a long-term commitment to technological development. Knut Sogner adapted his book into a short English version in 2004, and he updated it with a new chapter portraying the last ten years\nAfter being acquired by Orkla in 2005, selling off the aluminium and power businesses, and being acquired by China National Bluestar in 2011, Elkem has now returned its main focus to the business areas that started with the invention of the S\u00f6derberg electrode in 1917.\nWith the sustainable and innovative production of silicones, silicon for renewable energy, silicon-based alloys and carbon products, we are looking to strengthen our position in key markets as well as to expand in new parts of the world.\nIn June 2017 Elkem assumed management responsibility of Xinghou Silicones, a silicones producer, and Yongdeng Silicon Materials, a silicon producer.\nThe two plants now form part of Elkem\u2019s silicon value chain, from quarts to downstream silicones specialities, and gives Elkem increased access to the Chinese market.\nIn March 2018 Elkem became listed on Oslo B\u00f8rs again, Elkem ASA.\nAs Elkem turns another decade, there are great opportunities ahead, particularly with silicon being a key element in renewable energy solutions."}]}, {"name": "ALOHCO TRADERS LTD", "description": "Composite manhole cover, gully gratings, and FRP water tank manufacturers.", "address": "MARCUS GARVEY, NAIROBI, KENYA  Kenya", "details": {"Business Type": "Service provider", "Industry Type": "Stormwater", "Market Focus": "Internationally (various countries)"}, "panels": []}, {"name": "Terrapinn Ltd", "description": "Terrapinn is a business media company.

Other agencies for equipment for the steel industry were obtained and also a small steam boiler was developed and manufactured locally. Safurnco have facilities to modernise existing mills.\n\nIn 1977 an agreement was reached with Hubert Davies/Blue Circle Limited whereby Blue Circle obtained financial control of Safurnco, enabling John Mitchell to retire in 1979. Safurnco was asked by Blue Circle to run Hubert Davies Projects. The name was changed to Blue Circle Projects (Pty) Limited and subsequently Safurnco became a division of the new organisation under the management of W H van der Mey.\n\nIn 1982, D A Kirk took over as Managing Director from W H van der Mey who was keen to retire.\n\nIn June 1984, it was decided amicably and mutually by Blue Circle and Safurnco that it would be to Safurnco\u2019s advantage to seek a new partner with similar interest to form a company outside the Blue Circle Group. This led to Protectaire (Pty) Limited making a bid for the assets of Safurnco and its good name.\n\nProtectaire was formed in 1973 by S P Dowdle with H P Thieme joining the company in 1975. The Company dealt mainly in industrial heating equipment with reputable agencies such as MACROburn Incinerators, Peabody Combustion Equipment and Marine & Industrial Oil Heaters. Their activities were considered to be most complimentary to those of Safurnco.\n\nThe company merger took place on the 1st September 1984, and it was decided to retain the name SAFURNCO for the Trading Company. D A Kirk and H Singleton remained members of the Safurnco Board throughout the periods of change and amalgamation (both have now retired) being joined on the board by S P Dowdle as Managing Director and H P Thieme as Marketing Director.\n\nWe believe that the Protectaire-Safurnco tie-up has produced mature, well-balanced company that will continue to do full justice to the products handled by them and provide clients with the type of service and after-sales service that they would expect.\n\nIn June 1992 the company converted to a Close Corporation. The ownership and management remained unchanged until the untimely passing away of S P Dowdle in January 2000. His son, J S P Dowdle took up the position as Managing Director shortly afterwards.\n\nIn July 2003 Safurnco split into Saubatech( Pty) Ltd and Safurnco SA(Pty)Ltd in order to give more focus to the marketing of the various products offered. .

The first recorded sales revenues involved the machining and assembly of stainless steel valves, pipe fittings and other components. Sales for the first year of operation totaled $60,000.\u2028\u2028  1948 At the end of five years of operation, annual sales volume had increased to $330,000 and the company had grown to approximately 40 employees. Design and production of the company's first hydraulic cylinder led the way in Cascade's aggressive pursuit of new business opportunities.  During the 1950's, Cascade began to design, manufacture, and sell hydraulic attachments. In 1956, construction was completed on a new facility to house all plant and office operations in Portland, Oregon -- this building is now Cascade's world headquarters. After 15 years in business, sales had reached nearly $2.3 million and total employment stood at 180.\u2028\u2028  In 1959, Cascade broadened its base of operations with a second manufacturing plant in Springfield, Ohio. The following year marked Cascade's initial move into the global arena, with interests established in companies in The Netherlands, England and Australia.\u2028  In 1964, the company name was changed to Cascade Corporation. Cascade went public with an initial offering of 200,000 shares of common stock in 1965.  1967 Cascade opens a subsidiary operation in the Republic of South Africa and acquires C.M. Scott Fluid Power, Ltd., a Canadian manufacturer of hydraulic cylinders located near Toronto, Ontario.  1968 Our 25th year in business was an exciting period. Approval was received from the Japanese government to form a wholly-owned Cascade subsidiary operation in Japan. Ramey Hydraulic Loaders, Inc of Roseburg, Oregon was acquired. Construction of a new Cramlington, UK manufacturing plant was completed.  1973-74 Ramey Hydraulic Loader operations were discontinued. Diamond, NV, a 20,000 square foot plant located in Hoorn, The Netherlands is acquired by Cascade to help meet growing European market demands.  1978 In our 35th year of business total employment stands at 1,330.   1980 A new manufacturing plant opened in Warner Robins, Georgia to expand US production of sideshifters. Subsidiary operations now manufacture Cascade products worldwide.   1982 Severe economic recession in both the United States and Europe results in a 25% decline in consolidated net sales, employment levels were reduced from 1175 to 760.  1986 Cascade enters into a joint venture agreement with the Xiamen Forklift Company located in Xiamen, (Xiamen-Cascade Corporation, Ltd) for the production and sale of attachments in the Peoples Republic of China.  1988 A new 110, 000 square foot facility in Westminster, South Carolina dedicated to production of the new Cascade World Mast is completed. Sales reach nearly $140.2 million, earnings hit a record level, and total employment rises to 1005.  Cascade expanded its product offering dramatically in 1996 and 1997 with the acquisition of five companies including Kenhar Corporation, the global leader in forks.  1999 marked the sale of the world mast product line and Industrial Tires Limited-two of the five companies acquired in 1996 and 1997. In 2002 the cylinder division was sold to Precision Hydraulics, a newly formed company headed by Chris Barclay. The sale included manufacturing facilities in Beulaville, North Carolina and Cramlington, Northumberland, United Kingdom.   The year 2003 was notable as the company\u2019s 60th anniversary as well as a number of key acquisitions in the European market. Cascade acquired fork manufacturer FEMA of Germany; ITAB, a Swedish manufacturer of paper roll handling products; and Roncari, the leading supplier of attachments to the Italian lift truck market.  2004 marked the acquisition of yet another fork company, Falkenroth. In addition to forks, the Schalksm\u00fchle, Germany based Falkenroth group also manufactured lines of drop forgings and excavator teeth. The purchase provides Cascade OEM customers with assurances that the capacity will be available to meet their production requirements, even in the most rapidly-expanding markets.   China in 2005 becomes the third largest national lift truck market behind the United States and Japan. To sustain our current market position in the Chinese market, Cascade expands the capacity of Chinese fork facilities and makes significant investments in Xiamen and Hebei operations. In Mid 2005 Cascade entered into a distributor agreement with a facility in Santos, SP, Brazil, South America.   2006 In August, the Warner Robbins plant produced its millionth Sideshifter. December marked the acquisition of PSM, a manufacturer of attachments for the construction industry-a new market for Cascade.   2007 Cascade Asia marked a number of significant anniversaries: a 40th anniversary for Cascade Japan, a 20th anniversary for Cascade Xiamen (China) and the opening of a new fork facility for Cascade Heibei who celebrated a 10th anniversary in 2007. The acquisition of American Compaction Equipment, Inc. becomes the next step into the Construction Attachment market. Shipments from the new Xiamen (China) and Hebei (China) fork factories begin. The year also marked the Introduction of Chinese produced forks into the European market and the expansion of the attachment production capacity in Xiamen.    2008 marked the launch of the Cascade \u201c WorldForkTM\u201d, a high volume commodity fork featuring standardized engineering specification. In response to the unprecedented economic environment Cascade made significant personnel reductions in all regions. All Cascade manufacturing operations moved to some form of flexible reduced work schedules. Total personnel costs reduced by 30% to 35% in North America and Europe compared to last year.  2009 Due to downturns in the economy, Cascade closes fork plants in France and Germany and the attachment facility in Almere, The Netherlands. All European attachment manufacturing operations are consolidated in Verona, Italy.  2010 marks an accelerated recovery of the global lift truck industry. The Chinese market reaches historic highs in terms of lift truck shipments.   In 2011 a massive flood strikes the Queensland area of Australia, team members from around the globe participate in recovery efforts to ensure Cascade Australia customers are not impacted.  2013 \u2013 Cascade reinforces the Rental & Reman services by adding another facility in Almere, The Netherlands to serve the northern European countries in a timely manner.This new opening in the Netherlands, along with a new Rental and Reman site in Italy, will allow Cascade the ability to provide attachments for rental and used products in just 2 weeks throughout all Europe.  2014 \u2013 Cascade announces the expansion of their Cascade Remanufacturing Center (CRC) in Mississauga, Ontario, in a new building adjacent to the existing Canadian corporate offices and manufacturing facility.  2015 \u2013 Cascade wins \u201cProduct of the Year 2014\u201d award from Plant Engineering Magazine for TFCTM - Touch Force Control, the innovative touch-screen clamp force control system.

In this regard, the city\u2019s official waste management service provider, Pikitup Johannesburg (Pty) Ltd, has a crucial role to play. Founded in January 2001 with the City of Johannesburg as its sole shareholder, Pikitup took its place in a society recovering from the mistakes of the past but energised by hope for the future. It was an era of comprehensive change at all levels of national and local government, and not least in the waste management sector. Traditionally, South Africa had followed an \u2018end of pipe\u2019 waste management philosophy that resulted in a small percentage of waste being recycled, with the remaining bulk of the waste stream being disposed of at landfill sites. With urban real estate at a premium, and our natural resource base under growing pressure, a new national waste management strategy was needed \u2014 and formulated.", "address": "41 Upington, Cape Town, Northern Cape  South Africa", "details": {"Business Type": "Service provider", "Industry Type": "Waste Management", "Market Focus": "Locally (one state or province)"}, "panels": [{"title": "About us", "description": "The new integrated Waste Management Policy and the National Waste Management strategy seeks to minimise the waste stream going to landfills, while extracting maximum value from the waste stream at all stages of the collection and disposal process. The strategy also introduced a slew of rigorous new environmental regulations, designed to bring South Africa\u2019s waste management in line with the Best Environmental Practices In the world  As the biggest waste management company in Africa , Pikitup not only operates entirely within the strict new regulations stipulated by law, the company has also formulated and has commenced the implementation of its own sustainable integrated waste management strategy to turn Joburg into one of the cleanest cities in the world. Current world Best Practice standards dictate that only 10% of the waste stream should end up in landfills. The broad goal of Pikitup\u2019s strategy is to support the national vision of \u2018Zero waste to landfills by 2022\u2019. While it is a practically unattainable goal \u2014 some waste will always have to be disposed of at landfills \u2014 it nevertheless remains an ideal and focused goal.  Even a cursory glance at the numbers reveals the enormity of the challenge facing Pikitup. The 1625 square kilometre area of the City is home to 3,8 million people and around 787 000 dwellings. Apart from collecting and disposing of the domestic refuse generated by the city residents, Pikitup also offers commercial services to some 17 000 businesses in the city and litter picks and sweeps approximately 9 000 kilometres of streets within Joburg\u2019s eleven regions. The city generates a total of 1,6 million tons of waste per annum. To put some perspective on that figure, it\u2019s equal to the combined weight of Chicago\u2019s Sears Tower and New York\u2019s Empire State Building \u2014 doubled.  Pikitup's present services are restricted to the geographical area of the City of Johannesburg and is well equipped to meet Joburg's waste collection and disposal demands. The company has over 4 000 employees operating from 11 depots, with its fleet of around 500 vehicles constantly shuttling between customers, its 4 landfill sites, incinerator and 42 garden refuse sites across the city. Pikitup has modernised and improved waste collection systems by constantly upgrading its fleet, and has delivered 472 000 new 240 litre wheeled bins in the phased replacement of the old refuse bag system. Yet the challenge lies not just in the mere act of collecting and disposing of the city's waste, but also in how this is accomplished.  Recycling is key to the twin goals of minimising the waste going to landfills and extracting maximum value from the waste stream. Separating recyclable materials \u2014 glass, paper, metals and certain plastics \u2014 out of the waste stream reduces the bulk of waste going to landfills, eases the strain on our natural resources, and helps to create employment in both the informal and formalised waste reclamation sectors.  Pikitup works with recycling companies to launch and support recycling initiatives, particularly at community level. Pikitup\u2019s support has been vital in the establishment of five community-run recycling buy-back centres located across the city, and more centres are planned for the future. Pikitup is actively involved in recycling research, and is investigating recycling joint ventures with international partners. The company supports recycling and processing of green garden waste into soil-enhancing compost, via the recent establishment of its pilot Composting Plant at the Panorama site in Roodepoort.  As the official waste management company for Joburg, Pikitup provides services for the City\u2019s major events, such as the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Both events were a great success and, apart from the obvious benefits of presenting a clean and hygienic city image to Joburg\u2019s international guests, allowed Pikitup to showcase and refine its strategy, ensuring that the influx of visitors created no increase in the waste going to landfills.  While Pikitup has accepted custodianship of the city's cleanliness, the city's residents also have a vital role to play. Unfortunately, there is a pervasive mindset among Joburg citizens that tolerates littering and illegal dumping. The negative consequences of this mindset extend far beyond the visible blight of unhealthy illegal dumps. It costs the City R170 million per annum to clean up street littering and illegal dump sites - money that could be far better utilised on 7 350 RDP houses, 588 new ambulances or any number of other projects to bring the city up to world-class standards. Pikitup's ongoing 'Project 100 Spots' campaign is not only dedicated to cleaning up illegal dumping sites, but also informing communities about the hazards of illegal dumping, and encouraging them to take stewardship of these sites.  It is however not any one individual or company's job to turn Joburg into a world-class city, instead as our company\u2019s slogan states,  Serving you, saving our environment  Pikitup supports the City's goals fully, and also supports others who share the vision of a world-class Joburg. We welcome suggestions from any of our customers, the citizens of Joburg, on how to improve our service. In turn, we will gladly advise or assist businesses or other City roleplayers in solving their waste management issues. By working together with focused goals and a shared vision, there is no reason why we cannot turn Joburg into a truly world-leading city like Copenhagen or Singapore."}]}, {"name": "Absorbetech Environmental", "description": "Absorbetech Environmental is the manufacturer of the hydrocarbon absorbent ABSORBETECH and our associated products.\u00a0We are a South African company based in Durban, KwaZulu Natal, with representation via a number of distribution agents locally and internationally.\u00a0Absorbetch is manufactured locally from the waste stream of an existing industry and thus does not add to the depletion of our natural resources, nor will it harm our environment as it is totally biodegradable.", "address": "22 Palmgate Crescent, Durban, Amanzimtoti  South Africa", "details": {"Business Type": "Manufacturer", "Industry Type": "Oil Spills", "Market Focus": "Internationally (various countries)"}, "panels": []}, {"name": "Pioneer Pump - Franklin Electric Co., Inc.", "description": "Our story started in 1998, when four dedicated professionals set out to build a new company with a single-minded focus on superior hydraulic performance.

The circle closes and a natural cycle is complete; wood briquettes only return as much CO2 to the atmosphere as is absorbed by a growing tree through photosynthesis.\nIf the material requires any kind of pre-treatment such as drying or crushing, the effort involved is significantly lower than with alternative methods of compaction.

Eco Global Sales is a privately held company founded in 2007 on the core belief that eco-friendly, non-toxic waste treatment products have become a necessity in today\u2019s environmentally sensitive and fragile ecosystem.\nUnlike liquid treatment systems, these tablets fall to the bottom of the tank for treatment, and dissolve over time releasing the multifunctional chemicals. The tablets are designed to dissolve slowly through the use of natural water soluble polymers and synthetic non-hazardous polymer binders. All of the ingredients in the tablets are environmentally safe and do not require any special permitting to meet effluent or pretreatment requirements.   The tablets dissolve releasing sodium carbonate peroxydate, a solid form of hydrogen peroxide. The subsequent release of oxygen causes an immediate bubbling action that disperses the oxygen throughout the tank. The sodium carbonate portion of the salt then buffers the water to a neutral pH. The oxygen released reacts immediately with any hydrogen sulfide (and other sulfides, thiols, and mercaptans) creating non-toxic sodium sulfate and various salts of the organic sulfides. The oxygenation of the water mitigates sulfide odors and ultimately prevents the corrosion of pipes, pumps, and valves due to the elimination of the acid hydrogen sulfide and other naturally occurring acids in the wastewater. Because the tablet descends to the bottom of the tank, the action of the tablet during the dissolution causes bubbling within the bottom sludge. The combination of the oxygenation and buffering of the water, bubbling action, and the release of aerobic bacteria initiates the biodegradation of the oil and grease and other organic sludge. In a system with constant flow, a scheduled application of eco-tabsTM will remove the oil and grease sludge completely, leaving only solids the will not degrade or breakdown (e.g. plastic applicators, bottle caps, etc). A continual application of eco-tabsTM removes hydrogen sulfide and digest residual organic sludge and is one of the easiest and most cost-effective treatments.  In summary, eco-tabs are designed to:"}]}, {"name": "Huber SE", "description": "HUBER SE, headquartered in Berching, Germany, is a worldwide active company in the field of water, wastewater and sludge treatment.

The water sprays through nozzles onto banks of material called 'fill,' which slows the flow of water through the cooling tower, and exposes as much water surface area as possible for maximum air-water contact. As the water flows through the cooling tower, it is exposed to air, which is being pulled through the tower by the electric motor-driven fan.\nWhen the water and air meet, a small amount of water is evaporated, creating a cooling action. The cooled water is then pumped back to the condenser or process equipment where it absorbs heat.

The uncompressed material is rotated around the axis of the chamber and as more material enters, the chamber compression of the material increases.\nThe bale compression increases as more material is force fed into the chamber and the bale becomes evenly firm and stable. Only relatively low power is required to compress material in this way. Softer and smaller material fragments surrenders and embeds larger and harder objects during the compression process.\nThe computer system monitors the com\u00adpression, by measuring the hydraulic pressure in the system.\nThe operator sets the compression level required for the baled material via the computerized system.\nNetting\nWhen full chamber pressure is reached, a net is wound around the bale. The net is fed into the chamber by means of jet air nozzles.\nThe net wound around the surface of the bale maintains its form and prevents the compressed material from expanding when the chamber is opened as well as increasing the mechanical strength of the bale.\nThe net is made of environmental friendly polythene. A roll of net is sufficient for more than 100 bales, and is easily changed by the operator.\nThe operator sets the required number of windings of the net and the computer system checks continuously that the net is properly fed.\n\nTransfer to the wrapping unit\nThe baling chamber opens up and the heads of the chamber are pressed towards each circular end of the bale to hold it firmly during the transfer to the wrapping unit. The net wrapping and the high bale compression minimises material loss.\nWrapping\nThe bale is wrapped with a thin, strong and stretchable plastic film which is air tight and water resistant.\nThe wrapping is made by means of a sweep arm which rotates on the wrapping table to give a 50% overlap of film on the bale.\nWhile the bale is being wrapped, the heads of the baling chamber returns to the baling position. The baling chamber closes and new material is fed into the unit. When wrapping is completed, the film is cut and the bale is loaded to the bale conveyor.\nThe stretch film, although thin, is very tough. This ensures the hermetic enclosure of the material which prevents the escape of litter as well as stops the degradation processes.\nThe stretch film and the net in which the bales are wrapped consists of polythene which converts to carbon dioxide and water when incinerated. The plastic film is only 25-30 \u00b5m and it constitutes of only 0,1-0,2% of the total weight of the bale. A roll of stretch film is sufficient for 15-25 bales depending on the number of layers. Rolls of film is easily replaced by the operator.\nUnloading\nThe wrapped bale is tilted onto a bale conveyor for unloading to further transportation or storage. If the conveyor is equipped with a scale and a marking unit, each bale can for example be marked with weight, material type or with a bar code, depending on the demands of the job."}, {"title": "Flexus \u2013 an environmentally and commercially sound solution", "description": "Low Energy Consumption\nA complete plant with press, bale wrapper and conveyors consumes no more than 10-40 kW/h.

The functions of the press are electro-hydraulically powered. The press chamber has rotating sides and the feeding mat rests on rollers with ball bearings.\nLeakage and Leaching\nThanks to the lack of oxygen inside the round bale there is no fermentation occurring inside. Storage is therefore without risk of build-up of methane gas. Poisonous substances can not be leached, since the stretch film effectively restrain all water from penetrating inside the bale (provided that the bales aren't submerged in water).\nStretch Film and Net\nThe stretch film and the net in which the bales are wrapped consist of polythene, which converts to carbon dioxide and water when incinerated. The plastic film is thin, only 25-30 \u00b5 and it constitutes only 0,1-0,2% of the total weight of the bale.

In the aerobic phase the main degradation is oxidation reactions which produce CO2. Combustion and thermal degradation can be the consequence of this phase.\nDuring the anaerobic degradation, three meta\u00adbolically different groups of bacteria become active and result in hydrolytic, aceto\u00adgenic and finally methanogenic degradation. This biodegradation process in which the organic substances are acting as a nutrient as well as an oxidation agent is a result of coordinated action of many different bacteria species in sequential reactions.\nAny disturbance in such a consecutive system can delay or accelerate some of the biochemical step reactions and this affects the degradation rate and energy/mass losses in the stored material.

On the morning of March 26, 1912, the Jed Mine in West Virginia exploded. In a flash, methane gas ignited and more than 80 miners lost their lives. From this tragedy, mine engineer John T. Ryan Sr. had an epiphany: \u201cIf I could spend my life doing what I can to lessen the likelihood of the occurrence of such terrible disasters, I shall feel in the end that my life had been well spent.\u201dRyan recruited colleague George H. Deike to help realize his vision for a new company. Recognizing the critical importance of dependable, safe mining equipment, they went straight to one of the country\u2019s great thinkers: Thomas Edison. The brilliant inventor helped Ryan and Deike create the electric cap lamp which, over the next 25 years, reduced mine explosions by an astounding 75 percent. Of all his inventions, this was the one that did the most for humanity, Edison would later say in life.In the decades that have come and gone, MSA has continued to lead the charge for workplace safety. We\u2019ve led the way with small first-aid kits and portable methane detectors, and harnessed new technologies to produce state-of-the-art thermal imaging cameras, ballistic helmets, and leading edge systems for gas and flame detection.But we\u2019ve never forgotten where we came from, or why we\u2019re here.

In the early 1960s the first sprayer with engine axles ventilators and steel tanks are produced and the success is so high that in 1973 Danilo\u2019s son, Giuseppe Faccio, enlarges the enterprise and moves to another area. And thanks to Giuseppe and his brothers, who have new and fresh ideas, new and promising machines for crops protection are introduced. Indeed, in the 1970s the first low volume sprayers are produced, and are particularly aimed at medium and low volume treatments on vineyards (and/or other crops with similar plantation systems).\nIdeal\u2019s growth and development continues, also thanks to the production of pneumatic equipments for pruning and olives harvesting, so much that in 1992 stubborn and dynamic Giuseppe Faccio decides to enlarge the factory once more.

Lowering tapes down the well can be challenging. The tapes get caught and hungup on wires and pipes. They get false indications from cascading water and condensation. And it is labor intensive reeling the tapes down and back up. Then there are the decontamination issues. Pushing a tape down a crooked or sloped well can be nearly impossible. The submersible pressure transducers have similar issues with the added uncertainty about their location and reliability.Then there are the acoustic or sonic devices which send sound pulses into the well. While they are very convenient and fast, they are susceptable to imperfections in the well such as open perforations, open fissures or pockets, or even pipe fittings on the drop pipe, all of which can cause incorrect readings.The bottom line is that there is not a perfect solution for every well. But where the tape may not be able to fall into a sloped well, the sound pulse has no problems. And where the sound pulse is lost in an open fissure, the tape may go right past.While the submersible technologies have been well established, the acoustic or sonic meters have left room for improvement. This is where our story begins.One of the biggest problems with the sonic meters is that the sound pulses tend to travel in straight lines and reflect off any imperfection in its path. The degree to which it does so is a function of the sound frequency. The higher the frequency, the more directional the beam, and the smaller the obstruction that will reflect the sound. Ultrasonic detectors are commonly used for measuring streams from bridges and levels in tanks through open air. This is possible because the very high frequency sound travels as a beam in the direction it is launched. It is also able to detect small objects crossing the beam. It cannot detect the water level through a pipe, however, because the ultrasonic beam takes many paths through the pipe. A very small part of the beam travels straight through the pipe, while part takes one bounce off the wall, and some may bounce 20 times making the path much longer. This is combined with the reflections from every pipe seam and wire bend in the pipe. The net result is noise."}, {"title": "Other sonic meters have been developed for measuri...", "description": "Other sonic meters have been developed for measuring through pipes using a much lower frequency sound close to 200hz. At this frequency, the sound waves spread out and pretty much fill the space available to them. This makes it unsuitable for measuring a stream level from a bridge or level in a tank for example. But when confined to a pipe, the wave fills the pipe and travels as a single wave, eliminating the multipath issue with the ultrasonic waves.\nBut even at this frequency, small imperfections cause a significant portion of the sound pulse to be reflected and can appear like it has reflected off the water. Here is where Eno Scientific has taken this sonic technology to the next level. The Eno Scientific Well Sounders were developed to use an even lower frequency, down to 50hz. At these frequencies, the sound pulse acts more like you would expect from an air pressure wave. At these slow speeds, the air fills all the space along the route flowing around obstacles. The reflections from most pipe couplings and minor obstructions become insignificant.\nWhy doesn't everyone do it this way? The advantages are obvious. The answer is that it is much harder to do. Generating a clean low frequency pulse is more difficult. It is also much more difficult to determine the exact location of a slowly changing pressure wave than a quick one. Eno Scientific was able to solve these problems using powerful digital signal processing techniques and electronics."}, {"title": "Not only has Eno Scientific raised the bar in its ...", "description": "Not only has Eno Scientific raised the bar in its ability to use very low frequency pulses to measure the depth to the water, but also in the standard features included to make the users job easier.

Gradually, Fluxtek has built up its reputation in the water treatment industry and also gained trust from customers with products of excellent quality.\nOriginated from Taiwan and to form a supplying chain of green cycle economy\nMr. Yen-Tsun Lai, founder of Fluxtek, was grown up in southern Taiwan.

Mr. Lai saw this problem and started thinking what may be done to turn waste shells into useful materials for activated carbon production. So other than purchasing carbon materials from abroad, he also talked with the local coconut farmers for cooperation to integrate the resources, and also planned on building a plant for coconut food production as well as biomass carbonization for producing genuine activated carbon as material for filters. The heat generated during carbonization may be collected and applied on food processing. Furthermore, through recycling the household carbon filters and reactivate the carbon within, it may again be used for river restoration or as absorbent of toxic substances such as dioxin generated from waste incineration.

It was a 12-inch capacity Model 100 Brush Bandit.\u00a0   That machine was built in a 6,000 square-foot converted repair shop, with the support of six employees.\u00a0Upon its completion, Mike embarked on a\u00a015,000-mile tour to market his creation, receiving his first order for five chippers in December of 1983.\u00a0Mike,\u00a0along with his wife and co-owner Dianne Morey,\u00a0launched the company in what seemed like a blink of an eye, and the cuddly raccoon decal on each machine soon became \u201cBandit\u201d\u2014 the well-known face of the company. Throughout Bandit headquarters in mid-Michigan you can see images of the famous raccoon in photographs, paintings, pictures and wood carvings, of which many are\u00a0gifts from dealers and customers as a token of appreciation for years of service, dedication and support.\nThe Bandit Campus: That first 6,000-square foot stand-alone building was soon eclipsed, with a company expansion taking places on average every two years to accommodate and facilitate growth.\u00a0That expansion still continues\u2013present manufacturing facilities exceed 280,000 square feet at two mid-Michigan locations, Millbrook and North Winn.\u00a0The\u00a0most recent expansion was completed in the spring of 2015 at the whole tree chipper manufacturing facility.\u00a0  Made in Michigan, Used World-Wide: Bandit Industries, Inc. is a full-line manufacturer of unique hand-fed and whole tree chippers, stump grinders, waste reduction Beast recycler units, high-powered forestry mowers and specialty equipment like the Model 60FM forestry mulch attachment for skid-steer loaders. All equipment is built at Bandit\u2019s mid-Michigan location near Mount Pleasant and is sold in over 50 countries, literally covering every portion of the globe.\nTalent: With each expansion, Bandit sought out and hired hardworking, local talent to keep growing in the right direction. Jerry Morey and Dennis Tracy joined the Bandit team in 1987, becoming part-owners with Mike and Dianne. With Dianne Morey serving as Bandit's human resources director, the company grew to over 200 employees in the late 1990s. That growth reached new heights in 2010, with the company's global workforce nearly doubling in the three years that followed. With Rosie Ebbinghaus\u00a0serving as HR director, Bandit currently employs approximately 500 people. Bandit's strength lies heavily in the quality and commitment of the employees, many of whom have been with the company for over 20\u00a0years and have grown with Bandit to become managers.  Whole Tree Chippers: In the early 1990s, Bandit introduced whole tree chippers for tree service and land clearing contractors. Through regular contact and feedback from customers, Bandit has continually led the whole tree chipping market for durability, reliability and performance. Disc and drum-style whole tree chippers are available with capacities up to 36 inches in diameter and over 1,000 horsepower, filling\u00a050-foot trailers with chips in as little as seven minutes. Innovations in chipper design, aggressive feed systems, and features like optional loaders or self-propelled undercarriages further make Bandit whole tree chippers the class leaders that so many companies appreciate.  Beast Horizontal Grinders / Recyclers: In 1995, the Beast entered the scene. These unique waste reduction machines have become extremely popular in the tree care, land clearing, municipal and recycling industries.\u00a0They are also ideally suited for biomass operations. The patented cuttermill system provides the ability to cut, split or grind waste material into valuable products, ranging from conventional wood chips to mulch, asphalt, and a unique product called Bio-Sawdust\u2014a \u00bc-inch minus material ideal for wood pellet production.\nStump Grinders: The first Bandit stump grinder was introduced in 2003 at the annual Tree Care Industry (TCI)\u00a0Expo.\u00a0\u00a0Available as towable units, self-propelled with wheels or high-flotation track crawlers, Bandit's comprehensive line of stump grinders are industry leaders for the tree care, rental and landscaping industries.\nForestry Mowers / Mulchers: Experience with stump grinders in the land clearing and site development markets led Bandit to develop a line of extremely capable, high-capacity track carriers. These versatile machines can wield either a large stump grinder head or a high-capacity forestry mower, all designed in-house by Bandit with the goal of providing high-power, high-production land clearing for forest thinning operations, pipeline and utility clearing, agricultural reclamation and much more. They are able to clear large areas in dense, difficult terrain.\nBiomass: Bandit Industries has long been a proponent and strong supporter of renewable, carbon-neutral biomass energy. Bandit continues to work closely with professionals in the biomass industry to develop whole tree chippers, Beast recyclers and other specialty equipment ideally suited for the production of biomass fuel. High-quality, specifically sized wood chips are vital for biomass boilers and fuel wood markets to achieve the highest levels of efficiency.\u00a0Bandit\u00a0is a global\u00a0industry leader in the production of\u00a0these specific materials, serving biomass operations from pellet mills to direct-fire biomass boilers large and small, all around the world.  Hand-Fed Brush Chippers: Bandit's claim to fame has been the hydraulic-feed hand-fed brush chipper. They form the backbone of more than 50,000 Bandit machines sold and in operation all around the world. With numerous styles and sizes to choose from, Bandit's comprehensive line of hand fed chippers favoured by companies large and small, from the local tree care specialist to landscapers, large scale land clearers and loggers.\u00a0   Dealer Network: Bandit simply has the best dealer network in the industry, with locations all around the world to serve customers directly. Bandit dealers provide valuable services and support to their customers on the front lines thanks to extensive factory training in both sales and service, ensuring that customers receive the best equipment and follow-up support possible. Recent company growth has seen this dealer network expand rapidly; since 2011 Bandit has added a new dealer nearly every month on average. There are currently over 160 Bandit dealer locations in over 50 countries.  Bandit Customers: In the end, Bandit's customers have remained the number one priority. 'We pride ourselves on the number of repeat customers who buy and rent our equipment,' said Bandit Industries President Jerry Morey. 'Listening to the ideas and suggestions of those who use our equipment has led to the development of many of our products. We consider our relationship with our customers a partnership.

He was working on a long metal pipe that held round bottom flasks for a local grain laboratory to remove acid fumes. The process was known as Kjeldahl nitrogen determination.\nThe salesman and the inventor formed a partnership named Laboratory Construction Company. Their mission\u2014to build and sell Kjeldahl apparatus to the numerous milling companies in the area.\nEarly years were lean, but the company survived and added new products. Carts. Tables. Goldfisch Fat Extractors.\nIn 1939, Ralph\u2019s son, Redman, joined the business. During his 60-year career, his brand of building relationships, serving customers and caring for people helped the company thrive.\nIn 1957, Labconco, as we came to be called, outgrew the garage and moved to our present headquarters in south Kansas City. The modern era began.\nWe expanded from agricultural labs into other scientific markets. In the 1960s, Labconco introduced a series of fume hoods. They were lined with durable molded fiberglass, a signature feature still found in our Protector Premier line. Other equipment made with molded fiberglass, such as glove boxes, quickly followed.\nAlong the way, we established enduring relationships with laboratory supply dealers.

In 1976, biological safety cabinets. In 1984, water purification systems.\nIn 1989, we acquired Buchler Instruments, and with it, the expertise to add evaporators and centrifugal concentrators.

You can add Labconco to the list.Our company began in a small garage in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. In 1925, Ralph Callaway (right), a salesman and entrepreneur, stopped in to have his car battery repaired. Philip Goldfisch, an engineer and inventor, of sorts, operated the garage. Ralph noticed an unusual apparatus in the back\u2014a long metal pipe for a local grain laboratory to remove acid fumes during Kjeldahl determination. It piqued Ralph\u2019s interest.The two formed a partnership, named Laboratory Construction Company, to build Kjeldahl apparatus for the numerous milling companies in the area. The early years were lean, but the company survived and new products were added. Carts. Tables. The patented Goldfisch Fat Extractor. In 1939, Ralph\u2019s son, Redman (left), joined the business and left an indelible mark throughout his 60-year career with the company. In 1957, Labconco, as we came to be called, outgrew the garage and moved to our present headquarters in south Kansas City. The modern era began.We branched out from agricultural labs into other scientific markets. In the 1960\u2019s, Labconco introduced a series of fume hoods lined with durable molded one-piece fiberglass, a signature feature found in our current Protector Premier line. Other equipment made with molded fiberglass, such as glove boxes, quickly followed.At the same time, we formed enduring relationships with laboratory supply dealers. Our dealers expanded our geographic reach and provided innovative product ideas suggested by end users.New products are the lifeblood of our company and spurred our growth. In 1969, we introduced a glassware washer. In 1974 came a line of freeze dryers. In 1976, our first biological safety cabinet premiered. In 1984, water purification systems were added. In 1989, we acquired Buchler Instruments, and with it, the expertise to add evaporation and centrifugal concentration to our family of products. One of our latest innovations, introduced in 2014, is the Purifier Axiom, the first Class II, Type C1 Biological Safety Cabinet in the world. The list continues to grow as we improve upon existing lines and develop new ones.In 1989, we added a manufacturing facility in Fort Scott, Kansas, ninety miles south of Kansas City. The company founded by two individuals now has more than 250 associates. An idea that started in a small garage in the Midwest now has placed equipment in laboratories worldwide.Throughout our history, we\u2019ve held onto the core values instilled by Redman Callaway: integrity, highest quality standards, and exceptional customer service. We are sincerely thankful to our customers, dealer partners and vendors throughout the years who have made our success possible, including you. With you, we intend to last another 90 years and beyond.\n"}, {"title": "Our Values", "description": "Labconco makes some of the best laboratory equipment in the world.

This technique involves directing a straight beam of light through a glass tube full of the sample on test. Our algorithms calculate the oil content based on the amount of light scatter detected at the optical receivers located at specific locations around the glass tube.\nMicroscopy\nDetermination of oil concentration by measuring the droplet size through image processing and recognition software. For this method, we use a microscope to look at the sample at a rate of three images per second. These images are then analysed by our software which can determine the visible differences between oil, gas and solids. The software will then determine the size and quantity of each object and display an accurate oil measurement, disregarding unwanted interference from gas and solids.\nFluorescence\nFluorescence is a very accurate technique for detecting oil in water. A straight beam of Ultra violet light at a known wavelength is directed into a glass tube filled with the sample on test. When oil droplets are excited by ultraviolet light, they will emit light at a different wavelength. Detectors located at very specific angles around the glass tube detect the light fluoresced from the oil. With the information from these detectors, our sophisticated algorithms can determine the oil content of the sample.\nUltra Sonics\nUltra-sonics is ideally suited to applications where optical detection principles will not cope, such as solid particles in heavy oils. For this technique, we direct an ultrasonic transducer into our sample where solid particles within the sample will scatter the ultrasonic waves. Ultrasonic receivers in certain positions will detect the ultrasonic feedback and our mathematical formulas can then calculate the concentration of contaminants."}, {"title": "Marine and Industrial Accreditations", "description": "Rivertrace Marine products meet standards of the following accreditations:\nMARPOL 73/78IMO resolution MEPC 107(49)IMO resolution MEPC 108(49)\nRivertrace Industrial products meet standards of the following accreditations:\nVarious National Standards including\u00a0CSA, DNV, LLOYDS, SIRE\nAll Rivertrace products are built and supported by ISO-9001:2015 Accreditation."}]}, {"name": "NCC Environmental Services (Pty) Ltd", "description": "NCC Environmental Services is a leading environmental consultancy and valued strategic partner to some of Southern Africa`s most respected environmental experts, engineering and construction companies.

A year later, the first overseas long-term assignment was implemented in Ethiopia and for several years, ORGUT supported rural development there. A steadily growing portfolio expanded from the initial forestry and sustainable land use support work to large integrated rural development, land administration and water sector projects. In the 80\u2019s, ORGUT ventured into West and East Africa focusing on food security, land management and local governance. Various successful long and short term projects established ORGUT firmly as the leading Swedish consultant and project management specialist in rural development. Geographical coverage soon encompassed some fifty countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. ORGUT also offered International Training Programmes in forestry and continued to implement rural development consultancies and environmental certification of forest products in Sweden.Three decades of rural project management experience had prepared ORGUT for the expansion into sector reforms and policy review in a new generation of projects. These projects linked best practices in decentralised natural resource management along with rights-based approaches, to national or regional reform. Large natural resource and market-led income generation projects expanded to Latin America and in South East Asia. Combining good governance and equitable access to natural resources remained a core element in many assignments as for example in the Sida funded LAMP. In 2002, the UNDP Equator Initiative Prize was awarded to the nine LAMP supported SULEDO villages for the sustainable management of community forests. By then, many ORGUT projects in sustainable agriculture, forestry and land use planning had introduced climate change mitigation and adaptation before these terms were widely adopted. As a recognized natural resource governance specialist and efficient project manager, ORGUT became increasingly engaged in large-scale water and sanitation sector projects in East and Southern Africa and the Middle East. In parallel, ORGUT saw strong growth in land administration, management and reform assignments in Eastern Europe and East Africa. Democratic governance and decentralization programmes, already initiated in the 90\u2019s at local levels reached national coverage in Tanzania and Vietnam. In the last decade ORGUT has also established itself as a service provider in private sector development services including market development, value chains and microfinance in Eastern Europe and Africa.ORGUT has always been, and still is, fully owned and controlled by its staff. This creates a strong professional and managerial commitment with a remarkably low staff turnover, guaranteeing continuity in results-oriented service delivery. The company\u2019s solid institutional memory is highly useful for concept, method and approach development.

Understanding these trends means that when there is a change it could be an early warning that there is a pollutant in the water or there has been a change in the aquatic ecosystem. Early detection is necessary to put mitigating measures in place.\nOur parameters are wide ranging, although the most commonly measured in surface water testing and monitoring are dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity and temperature, which are standard on most Aquaprobes. If you require specific parameters to be tested, there is the option to add additional parameters.\nPortable\nFor the ultimate in portable multiparameter water quality testing, look no further than our\u00a0AP-2000, which measures all the essential parameters in a handheld device. The AP-2000 can be used in conjunction with our\u00a0GPS Aquameter\u00a0that records the exact location of each data set so that once back in the lab you can view all your locations on Google Maps. If you need to measure a larger number of parameters, the\u00a0AP-5000\u00a0offers four auxiliary ports, two more than the AP-2000, and also measures depth. The AP-5000 is still portable and has many applications with a diameter of only 55mm.\nFixed monitoring\nBoth the AP-2000 and AP-5000 are suitable for short to medium term unmanned monitoring. The probes are connected to our AquaLogger, which has the capacity to capture data to months on end. If you require long term water quality monitoring, the\u00a0AP-7000\u00a0is specifically designed for this: it even cleans itself. The AP-7000 is used with the larger capacity\u00a0AquaLogger\u00a0and with a telemetry system that sends the data directly to your desk."}, {"title": "Waste Water Testing", "description": "Waste Water Testing\nThere is strict regulation surrounding waste water discharge so it\u2019s very important to conduct\u00a0waste water testing in waste water environments. Aquatic ecosystems are sensitive to even small changes in the chemical make up of the water, temperature, etc. Water parameter testing before discharge allows any pollutants to be detected and prevented from entering the watercourse. Real time testing allows quick action and minimises the risk of any potential fines that might be imposed by regulatory bodies should there be any regulatory violations. The rugged\u00a0AP-2000\u00a0protects the electrodes during deployment and allows all the essential parameters to be tested while it\u2019s portable design means that the device can be easily carried between locations. You can also save money on site visits by using telemetry.\nThe\u00a0AP-7000\u00a0self-cleaning probe can be hooked up to a telemetry device that uploads all the data online so that it can be accessed wherever and whenever you need it.

The HORIBA Radio Laboratory built the capacitor needed for the high-speed calculator (computer in today\u2019s terms) for nuclear physics experiments. This capacitor became renowned for its functions and quality, and HORIBA decided to start manufacturing it commercially. However, construction of the factory was halted by the steep rise in the cost of materials due to the conflict in Korea. The only thing to be done was to market the pH meter they had built to control the pH value of the capacitor\u2019s electrolyte. This pH meter was extremely well-received and before he knew it HORIBA was famous as a maker of pH meters.

In 1983, Palintest became a part of the global Halma plc Group.\nThe company can be traced back to the late nineteenth century when two chemists called Wilkinson & Simpson became involved in an apothecary business in Newcastle on Tyne. This business continued to thrive and develop in Newcastle on Tyne and eventually became a manufacturing chemist and pharmaceutical wholesaling business.\nThis business continued to the 1950\u2019s until the Company was approached by Dr Thomas Palin, a water scientist and chemist whose achievements included the development of breakpoint chlorination for water and the invention of the DPD method for the determination of chlorine.\nDr Palin\u2019s method became the standard method of chlorine determination throughout the world. Dr Palin also developed a system of chemical reagents presented in the form of reagent tablets and intended for use in the determination of chemical constituents of drinking water. He approached Wilkinson & Simpson Ltd to manufacture the reagent tablets and Dr Palin and the Company formed a partnership.\nEventually Wilkinson & Simpson Ltd became sole owners of the tablet reagent system developed by Dr Palin and Dr Palin became a consultant to the Company. During the 1970\u2019s the pharmaceutical and wholesaling and manufacturing business was sold and the Company's business became exclusively that of chemical reagent manufacture.\nIn 1983 the Company Wilkinson & Simpson Ltd was purchased by a British Corporation, Halma plc and considerable investment was made in Wilkinson & Simpson Ltd to improve the manufacturing process of its tablet reagent system and to develop a complete range of analytical equipment to be used in association with the reagent tablets. The reagents were marketed under the brand name \u2018Palintest\u2019.\nThe Company was renamed \u2018Palintest Ltd\u2019 in May 1989 to reflect both its registered trade mark and its association with Dr Palin, the father of the DPD method.\n"}, {"title": "Capabilities", "description": "To continue our long history of innovation and support our global customer base, Palintest applies a number of key skills and capabilities:"}, {"title": "Wagtech", "description": "In 2011, Palintest Ltd acquired the water testing division of Wagtech International.Initially christened \u2018Wagtech Water Technology Division\u2019 (or WTD for short) following acquisition, this key part of Palintest\u2019s international business has a critical focus on the aid and developing world sector and the crucial part water and sanitation (WATSAN) have to play in the improvement of lives and protection of the environment.

Custom components include small and large bushes, wear pads and strips, and many parts subject to friction and wear, in many industries including railways, shipping, heavy transport, earth moving, mining, and manufacturing.\nIn summary, VescoPlastics' special formulations and custom components find application in any industry with moving parts where there is a desire for longer life wear parts with the added benefits of less greasing and less maintenance.\nFOREIGN ASSOCIATIONS VescoPlastics has exported its products for over 25 years and the Vesconite trademark has been registered in most parts of the industrialised world, including the United States.\nIt has been the company's policy to expand abroad mainly through independent, well trained distributors fully dedicated to Vesconite. These include:\nThe company also has distributors in Argentina, France, Finland, Greece, Namibia, New Zealand, Zambia and Zimbabwe\nDISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING POLICY The specialised nature of the product range requires that it should be sold on the basis of its cost effectiveness in particular applications. Thus a well informed technical approach, related to the needs of a particular client or market, is generally required for success. This is a general requirement for selling high performance materials. The management devotes much of its time to the study and proposed solutions of such needs.\nThe education of the market and the solution of technical problems in as cost effective a manner as possible have been basic to the growth and success of the company. Coupled with this is an emphasis on client service and fulfilling promised deliveries.\nPROMOTION Promotion by means of the Internet and direct mail aims to inform the engineering and designer community and to encourage enquiries. Such enquiries are carefully studied, recommendations made and prototype trials initiated when the application and the economics appear promising. Use is also made of advertising and editorial engineering publications with a high readership of design engineers.\nMATERIAL ADVANTAGES Vesconite and Vesconite Hilube can claim after over 30 years of extensive usage to offer one of the best all round non-metallic bush and bearing materials, readily available, made of the only modified polymers of their kind, which combine low friction, low wear, self lubrication, good dimensional stability, very low water absorption, suitability for both dry and immersed applications, good load carrying ability, easy machinability - all at greater cost effectiveness than traditional bearing metals.\nPRODUCTION ADVANTAGES VescoPlastics is possibly the only company in the production of engineering plastic materials and finished components which also formulates, develops, compounds and produces its own raw materials.\nThis results in an intimate knowledge of its products and their capabilities and an ability of offer more cost effective solutions. Where an application is of sufficient scope, and requires a bearing material with special characteristics, VescoPlastics will consider the development of a custom formulation.\nCOMPANY ADVANTAGES VescoPlastics' main focus on engineering plastic applications as related to friction and wear problems gives it a great deal of effectiveness in solving existing problems and developing new applications.\nIts technical approach is less concerned with possible short term returns than with the need to satisfy the long term needs of its clients through a cost effective answer to their problems - by providing components and materials that last longer, with little or no greasing."}]}, {"name": "SAMSI PE ta SA Mechanical Seals PE ", "description": "We stock import and export mechanical seals \r\nfor all pumping industries.\r\nDistribute to over 30 countries and locals service and technical support.\r\nWeb Store , for ease of ordering.\r\nUnbeatable stock and Prices\r\nMechanical Seal Refurbishment, Repair Facilty to replace or repair all makes of Mechanical seals.\r\n", "address": "    South Africa", "details": {"Business Type": "Distributor", "Industry Type": "Commercial", "Market Focus": "Globally (various continents)", "Year Founded": "2001", "Employees": "1-10", "Turnover": "less than $1,000,000 US"}, "panels": []}, {"name": "Procon Environmental Technologies (Pty) Ltd.", "description": "Procon Environmetal Technologies (Pty) Ltd. offer a full scope of Environmental Products & Technologies, specializing in systems that minimize the impact of contamination on the environment and surrounding areas.

There is no need for special equipmentAEBT works where others cannot by using bio-surfactants which release sequestered contaminants.

NB: If the contaminant has ingressed past a depth of 500mm it is recommended that the contaminant is removed and placed into wind rows or placed into long piles not exceeding a height of 500mm prior to implementing the AEBT program.Analytical MonitoringMonitor target contaminant concentration TPH, TP and nutrient concentrations such as ammonia-nitrogen, Ortho-phosphate soil pH by implementing the following monitoring program.Establish the benchmark by taking soil samples of the contaminated area prior to implementing the AEBT program.Commence the monitoring program 21 days after implementing the AEBT program and repeat every 21 days until acceptable levels have been achieved.NB:Take the soil samples at the points indicated on a diagram at a minimum level of 150mm, pack, mark and date the samples in a plastic bag or plastic container and forward to your or our laboratory for analysis. [250gm per soil sample]\nImplementing AEBTInitially spray OilGone HB over the contaminated area by mixing @ a ratio of 1 part OilGone HB to 10 parts water.Apply Organic SoilFix at a ratio of 4kg per cubic meter by applying it evenly over the contaminated area, till / dig in and thoroughly turn Organic SoilFix into the contaminated area and water well.After seven days apply OSFN Organic SoilFix Nutrient and thoroughly till and aerate the soil and water liberally.Tilling exposes the buried hydrocarbon mixture to the heat [photosynthesis] and leaves the soil aerated.Turn the soil and water well weekly.A moisture content between 30 and 49 percent of soil holding capacity should be maintained during the AEBT program.What is BIOREMEDIATION?Bioremediation is a natural process that uses micro-organisms to transform harmful substances into non-toxic carbon dioxide, water and fatty acids. There is an almost unlimited supply of information that supports the successful application of bioremediation for the clean up of contamination, backed by agency clean-up closure certification.Micro-organisms, like all living creatures, require nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphate, carbon, water and environment to grow and survive. When these conditions are present, some micro-organisms will break down organic contaminants as a source of carbon for energy and growth.We provide a combination of chemical, microbiological and process technology that is synergistic in eliminating contamination. In general, we use a biodegradable chemical application to disperse the contamination into very small droplets. With this solution there are nutrients, water, enzymes and microbes. Since many of the better microbes used to consume petrochemical contamination are aerobic, we also add slow oxygen release agents to our solutions. Each of these additives plays a role in making our process work. By breaking the contamination into small droplets we create an exponentially greater surface area for the microbes to have access to the contamination. Around each droplet is a life support environment for the microbes to flourish, which consists of water and nutrients. The enzymes present break the contamination down so that the microbes can consume the carbon. This is very similar to the metabolic process used by humans to break down fats, sugars and other food substances.This process results in the contamination being metabolised by the microbes into harmless carbon dioxide and water. When the food source is depleted the microbes die off and the contaminated site is returned to its pre-contaminated state. All of our solutions, including microbes are non-pathogenic, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and biodegradable.Bioremediation ExplainedOver long periods of time and without human intervention, nature eliminates both natural and most man made pollution. This happens as naturally occurring micro-organisms, enzymes, chemicals and weather combine to eliminate toxins. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to greatly accelerate these natural processes by selecting, concentrating and acclimating micro organisms to attack and eliminate many hydrocarbon based toxic materials in a matter of weeks rather than decades. The use of these micro-organisms to consume and eliminate dangerous or unwanted hydrocarbon based contaminants like petroleum products is called bioremediation. Bioremediation can achieve the elimination of contamination in many environments with a speed and thoroughness much greater than traditional methods and at significantly lower costs.The process is fundamentally simple. Contaminants like creosote, fuel oil, toluene, and even PCBs are composed of carbon chain molecules. Some of the most toxic hydrocarbon contaminants also contain chlorine. Although too complex or too toxic for most living organisms to metabolise, there are naturally occurring micro-organisms that can be cultured to attack these compounds. When these micro-organisms, along with materials that provide them with other requirements like oxygen, are put in contact with the contaminants, they attack the complex hydrocarbon molecules and break them down into harmless by-products. In the process the micro-organisms ultimately die, leaving nothing but harmless organic residues like any other micro-organisms leave behind.The versatility of this method of clean up is remarkable. In many cases bioremediation can be used without any significant site disruption. For example, hydrocarbon contamination in aquifers can often be treated by injecting the micro-organisms into the well where they follow the contaminant plume and reduce the contamination to harmless materials. In some cases oil contamination can be eliminated with topical applications. In other cases the micro-organisms may need to be introduced into the soils with mechanical assistance like deep ploughing of the soils. In the more extreme cases the contaminated soils may be put into large containers where they are treated with the organisms and then returned directly to the site.Unique application potentials also exist. For example, contamination under concrete slabs can be remediated by introducing the organisms with horizontal boring or through the slab borings. This can eliminate the need for removal of slabs or buildings as traditional clean up processes would require. The economics of bioremediation are almost always significantly more favourable than other techniques. The primary reason is that there is no need for the hauling and expensive disposal costs of contaminated soils.On sites where contamination is confined to clearly defined areas it can be possible to begin the development process on the clean areas while bioremediation is in progress on the remainder of the site. This is possible because the process is generally not very disruptive and does not require the removal and replacement of large amounts of soil. Furthermore, while conventional remediation often just moves the pollution from one place to another, bioremediation actually eliminates the unwanted materials. Bioremediation should be considered as an environmentally and economically desirable option for any site where hydrocarbon based remediation is required."}, {"title": "Mission Statement", "description": ""}, {"title": "How To Use", "description": "Procedures for using :\nProcedure for treating Oil Spills on SoilThe following procedure is to be used to treat surface spills on soil (up to a maximum ingress of 100mm).

The key ingredient has always been a fully integrated product line innovatively engineered to meet the real needs of the process industry.\nIn our first year the company structure and product line was designed. By Christmas of 1986 the first valve prototypes were produced. Additionally, all sales and technical literature were prepared. A unique network of experienced distributors, with proven track records, was well under way. A suitable factory was located in March of 1987 and the first valve production runs began in June of that year. The initial butterfly valves were the Series 20/21 Sanitary/Chemical, the Series 30/31 General Purpose and the Series 35/36 Large Diameter.\nIn January 1988 we celebrated the opening of Bray U.K., our initial foreign location. Our third year was additionally marked by the opening of Bray Canada in July 1988 and Bray Mexico in January 1989. Bray Continental Europe operations began in June 1990. The start up of these four operations outside the U.S. significantly expanded our customer base, and established Bray as an international company. At home, the first Series 20/21 stainless steel valve bodies were produced in June of 1988.\nThe move to our present Bray U.S.A. factory location in September of 1990 was a significant milestone. This 61,000 sq. ft. building allowed for rapid expansion and increased production capabilities.\nBeginning in February of 1992 with the Series 50 Valve Status Monitor, several new products were introduced. The U.S. manufacture of the Series 90 Pneumatic Actuator started up in February of 1993 and the Series 22 HPV was in production later that year.\nThe next area of international expansion was the Pacific Rim. Bray Australia opened in December of 1993 with Bray China and Bray Hong Kong following in January and September of 1995, respectively. These countries represent some of the fastest growing economies in the world and offer enormous opportunities.\nTwo control products, the Series 52 2N1 ProxSensor introduced in March 1995, and the Series 70 R4 Electric Actuator in February 1996, are both marked by their innovative features and state-of-the-art design. In October 1996 we introduced the Series 70 Fieldbus Foundation Electric Actuator at the ISA exhibition in Chicago. This actuator was named a finalist in Plant Engineering Magazine Product of the Year awards and was also named one of \u201cThe Best Products of 1996\u201d by Design News Magazine. These new products, combined with the advanced benefits of our full product line, have established Bray as the technology leader.\nAlso in October 1996, Bray acquired the Bray/McCannalok line of high performance butterfly valves from McCanna, Inc. This acquisition added a whole new product line of high pressure, high and low temperature butterfly valves.\nIn April of 1997, Bray received two prestigious certifications. The highlight recognition was the certification of Bray U.S.A. to ISO 9001 quality standards. The certification of compliance was issued by ABS Quality Evaluations, Inc., a worldwide independent certifier. With the previous ISO 9002 certification of Bray U.K. and Bray Canada, along with the certification of Bray Europe in 1997 and Bray China in 1998, we now offer assurance of quality standards worldwide. Bray Mexico has also started the process of IS0 9002 compliance.\nThe second certification of 1997 was the API (American Petroleum Institute) 607 4th Edition awarded to the Series 40 Fire Safe design. This latest, most severe test, reflects the conditions of a fire in the field. Passing this test gives Bray a tremendous advantage in the Oil and Gas, Refining and Chemical industries.\nIn 2001, Bray U.S.A., U.K., Germany and China began manufacturing products that comply with the CE (Community of Europe) standards and carry the CE mark. In 2003 Bray received the PED (Pressure Equipment Directive) certification for our products worldwide and carry the PED mark. These approvals continue to be a very important component for our future.\nThe end of 1998 began a period of directed change and rapid expansion. Effective in October 1998, Bray changed the company name from Bray Valve & Controls to Bray Controls. Though valves still remain an important part of our business, our new name reflects an increasing emphasis on the development and sales of control products.\nNew divisions were added to the Bray world with the acquisitions of Flow-Tek, Inc. in 1999, followed by Ritepro Corporation and Ultraflo Corporation in the year 2000.\nFlow-Tek, Inc., based in Houston, manufactures a full range of ball valves and controls, including 3-Piece, Threaded, Flanged, Multiport and Control valves, actuators and control accessories. Founded in 1983, Flow-Tek has always manufactured high quality products and has sustained excellent growth through the years.\nRitepro, Inc., founded in 1963 and based in Quebec, Canada, produces exceptional 1'- 42' check valves, cam and groove quick couplings, and fluid handling loading and unloading equipment.\nUltraflo, headquartered in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, and founded in 1986 produces butterfly valves, controls and hopper tees for the process and transport industries.\nIn 2000 we expanded our Bray U.S.A. factory and facilities to a total of 110,000 sq. ft., including the Class 1000 clean room for sanitary valve assembly. The new Bray U.K. factory was completed in November of 2000 and a new China factory was finished in 2003. In 2002 we acquired our distributor in the Netherlands and formed Bray Benelux.\nOur control product development has rapidly increased as well. In 2001, Bray developed several industrial serial bus network products: the Series 70 DeviceNet Electric Actuator, the Series 52 Digital Actuator Interface, the Series 66 Analog Actuator Interface and the Series 52 AS-i Digital Actuator Interface. That year Bray also introduced the Series 70 digital Servo Plus II with solid state Servo control. All these microprocessor controlled products are the market of the future.\n2002 brought the production of the Series 90/91 Stainless Steel Pneumatic Actuator, and the Series 73 and Series 72 economical Electric Actuators. Additional products introduced were the Series 67 Electro Pneumatic Positioners and the Series 63 Solenoid, both offering advanced control with serial bus network capabilities.One of our latest product is the Series 92/93 Pneumatic Actuator, with center travel stops. This unit is an updated version of the Series 90.We have always stated that our initial goal was to become a leader in the butterfly valve and control market worldwide.Bray has met this goal, and \u2013 with the addition of our ball valve division \u2013 laid the foundation for continued exceptional growth. We believe our future holds unlimited potential for further success, and we will fulfill it.Our achievement of high performance is the direct result of our employees\u2019 dedication and enthusiasm, our distributors\u2019 knowledgeable service and our customers\u2019 trust and goodwill.

At the time, Reverse Osmosis Desalination Systems were just becoming commercially feasible and available, yet only for large municipal plants. The President of Standard Communications, Donald Thomas, was a boating enthusiast, and after reading of this new technology to 'make water', he had the vision that this method of producing potable water could be used on small, individual systems for the boating industry. Back then the only means of producing potable water aboard a boat was to either catch rain or use bulky, unreliable and inefficient heat evaporation systems. Alternatively, boats had to carry water which inevitably ran out much too soon, and at inopportune times.  The boating industry owes its gratitude to Donald Thomas for his vision, direction, and leadership in presenting one of the most important innovations of this century to the boating world. Donald Thomas is the true pioneer of small scale Reverse Osmosis Desalinations Systems, and most favorably changed the boating industry over 29 years ago. Horizon Reverse Osmosis continues to operate with that pioneering, innovative spirit, and has evolved its product line into a unique style ideally suited for marine use. Horizon Reverse Osmosis continues today to hold a major share of the world market.  Sea Recovery Corporation obtained Horizon Reverse Osmosis in December of 1993, and today, Horizon Reverse Osmosis is a major product line of its mother company. The unique styling and separate distribution system that made Horizon Reverse Osmosis successful over the years are maintained and preserved today, and this allows Horizon Reverse Osmosis' uninhibited growth and development to continue its success as a highly regarded brand name in reverse osmosis desalination equipment.  The current Seafari line of marine watermakers enhances all that Horizon Reverse Osmosis stands for and has achieved in the water-making world. It's no wonder that Horizon Reverse Osmosis' customer confidence and satisfaction rank as the highest in the industry."}, {"title": "Company Background", "description": "Since 1975, HRO Systems and Village Marine have been pioneering the method of producing potable water for the boating industry.

The water sprays through nozzles onto banks of material called 'fill,' which slows the flow of water through the cooling tower, and exposes as much water surface area as possible for maximum air-water contact. As the water flows through the cooling tower, it is exposed to air, which is being pulled through the tower by the electric motor-driven fan.\nWhen the water and air meet, a small amount of water is evaporated, creating a cooling action. The cooled water is then pumped back to the condenser or process equipment where it absorbs heat.

The uncompressed material is rotated around the axis of the chamber and as more material enters, the chamber compression of the material increases.\nThe bale compression increases as more material is force fed into the chamber and the bale becomes evenly firm and stable. Only relatively low power is required to compress material in this way. Softer and smaller material fragments surrenders and embeds larger and harder objects during the compression process.\nThe computer system monitors the com\u00adpression, by measuring the hydraulic pressure in the system.\nThe operator sets the compression level required for the baled material via the computerized system.\nNetting\nWhen full chamber pressure is reached, a net is wound around the bale. The net is fed into the chamber by means of jet air nozzles.\nThe net wound around the surface of the bale maintains its form and prevents the compressed material from expanding when the chamber is opened as well as increasing the mechanical strength of the bale.\nThe net is made of environmental friendly polythene. A roll of net is sufficient for more than 100 bales, and is easily changed by the operator.\nThe operator sets the required number of windings of the net and the computer system checks continuously that the net is properly fed.\n\nTransfer to the wrapping unit\nThe baling chamber opens up and the heads of the chamber are pressed towards each circular end of the bale to hold it firmly during the transfer to the wrapping unit. The net wrapping and the high bale compression minimises material loss.\nWrapping\nThe bale is wrapped with a thin, strong and stretchable plastic film which is air tight and water resistant.\nThe wrapping is made by means of a sweep arm which rotates on the wrapping table to give a 50% overlap of film on the bale.\nWhile the bale is being wrapped, the heads of the baling chamber returns to the baling position. The baling chamber closes and new material is fed into the unit. When wrapping is completed, the film is cut and the bale is loaded to the bale conveyor.\nThe stretch film, although thin, is very tough. This ensures the hermetic enclosure of the material which prevents the escape of litter as well as stops the degradation processes.\nThe stretch film and the net in which the bales are wrapped consists of polythene which converts to carbon dioxide and water when incinerated. The plastic film is only 25-30 \u00b5m and it constitutes of only 0,1-0,2% of the total weight of the bale. A roll of stretch film is sufficient for 15-25 bales depending on the number of layers. Rolls of film is easily replaced by the operator.\nUnloading\nThe wrapped bale is tilted onto a bale conveyor for unloading to further transportation or storage. If the conveyor is equipped with a scale and a marking unit, each bale can for example be marked with weight, material type or with a bar code, depending on the demands of the job."}, {"title": "Flexus \u2013 an environmentally and commercially sound solution", "description": "Low Energy Consumption\nA complete plant with press, bale wrapper and conveyors consumes no more than 10-40 kW/h. Which comes out as low as approximately 1-1,5 kW per finished bale.\nThe low energy consumption owes to the special patented construction of the press. The functions of the press are electro-hydraulically powered. The press chamber has rotating sides and the feeding mat rests on rollers with ball bearings.\nLeakage and Leaching\nThanks to the lack of oxygen inside the round bale there is no fermentation occurring inside. Storage is therefore without risk of build-up of methane gas. Poisonous substances can not be leached, since the stretch film effectively restrain all water from penetrating inside the bale (provided that the bales aren't submerged in water).\nStretch Film and Net\nThe stretch film and the net in which the bales are wrapped consist of polythene, which converts to carbon dioxide and water when incinerated. The plastic film is thin, only 25-30 \u00b5 and it constitutes only 0,1-0,2% of the total weight of the bale. A roll of stretch film weighs approximately 17 kg and is sufficient for approximately 18 bales.\nThe net is made of environmental friendly polythene. A roll of net weighs approximately 30 kg and is sufficient for approximately 100 bales.\nThe stretch film, although thin, is very tough. This ensures the hermetic enclosure of the material, which prevents the escape of litter as well as stops the degredation processes. The waste is compressed and wrapped with stretch film, into airtight bales. Without oxygen the processes of fermentation and degredation cannot start."}, {"title": "The Science of integrated baling & wrapping of MSW", "description": "Degradation processes in baled waste\nDegradation of waste involves two different processes; aerobic and anaerobic. In the aerobic phase the main degradation is oxidation reactions which produce CO2. Combustion and thermal degradation can be the consequence of this phase.\nDuring the anaerobic degradation, three meta\u00adbolically different groups of bacteria become active and result in hydrolytic, aceto\u00adgenic and finally methanogenic degradation. This biodegradation process in which the organic substances are acting as a nutrient as well as an oxidation agent is a result of coordinated action of many different bacteria species in sequential reactions.\nAny disturbance in such a consecutive system can delay or accelerate some of the biochemical step reactions and this affects the degradation rate and energy/mass losses in the stored material. By preventing oxygen and water from penetrating the waste, Flexus baling system offers such a disturbance, thus more or less halting the biochemical process.\nStudy of MSW baled & wrapped round bales\nScientific tests of waste stored in round bales were done at:\nLund University, Sweden, 1995\nDekra Report, Germany 1995\nCylergie, France 1995\nStorage of highly calorific waste, Germany: 1998\nArdlethan Commission of Enquiry, Australia 1999\nAustralian Museum, Sydney, Australia 1999\nDisposal Plant, Asslar, Germany 1999\nStorage of MSW in Spain, 2000\nScientific papers are available upon request."}, {"title": "Flexus \u2013 flexible solutions to scale for your needs", "description": "The material handling capacity of a bale press is largely dependent on the type and characteristics of materials for baling, as well as the manner of infeed and operational experience.\nFlexus has 3 baler models to choose from:\nFlexus Typhoon  -\u00a0 up to 40 bales/hour\nFlexus Breeze   - up to 15 bales/hour\nFlexus Breeze Mini  - up to \u00a0 5 bales/hour\nFeel free to contact us at Flexus Balasystem for more specific information.\nWe have in-depth experience in delivering our technology across 5 continents, for different industries and a wide variety of applications.\u00a0 Flexus is happy to share its worldwide experience with you."}, {"title": "Flexus \u2013 Bale Storage Calculator", "description": "A single bale has a diameter of approximately 120-135 centimeter, and it is 120 centimeter high.\nA normal wheel loader can easily stack 4 bales high (4,8 metres), but with a telescopic stacker we see regular stacks of 8 bales in height.

The Viking Age was the age of the sleek, speedy longship and this crucial advance in ship technology helped the Nordic people become a dominant force in politics and trade. Today another innovative Nordic exploration technology, SkyTEM, is being used to explore for critical resources, but now the ship sails the skies.\nIn Denmark, as in much of the world, the supply of drinking water is based entirely on groundwater resources. In the 1990s the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided that before land could be slated for urban development it had to first be examined to determine if aquifers were present in the area in order to protect them from potentially harmful human activities. In an effort to make sound decisions on how and where to protect these critical resources it was important to base decisions on accurate and reliable information, in this case, spatially dense hydrogeological maps.\nGround based methods produced highly accurate three dimensional data sets, but were slow and difficult to employ in hilly terrain or populated areas. Airborne systems at the time were not suited to detecting subtle variations and geological layering required for mapping aquifers. Also, conventional airborne systems were designed as \u201cbump detectors \u201c for mineral exploration and could provide either near surface or deep images \u2013 but not both. The R&D team of leading geophysicists, hydrologists and scientists within government and universities, eventually the initial SkyTEM team, set out to develop a method capable of mapping the near surface concurrently with mapping to depths of about 350 m \u2013 the interval where the aquifers resided. They also set out to collect highly accurate noise free data that was robust enough to create advanced map products within a few days of being acquired.\nWith these specific aims in mind the first SkyTEM high resolution electromagnetic system was developed. It was and still is an industry breakthrough \u2013 one that changed the industry \u2013 as it was the first and only system engineering with a Dual Moment transmitter designed for the simultaneous collection of shallow and deep data. Also unique is the development of a low-noise receiver that eliminates almost all of the primary noise from the transmitter \u2013 a problem that plagues all airborne EM systems. Another breakthrough is the elimination of system drift and the need to continuously calibrate the system during production flights. The SkyTEM frame is rigid enough to place an array of ancillary sensors. All sensors, including the magnetometer, are mounted on the rigid carrier frame and flown at low altitude ensuring that all measurements are recorded as close to the ground as is achievable from an airborne geophysical platform. This allows for increased accuracy and the collection of the highest lateral and horizontal resolution obtainable.\nIt was recognized early on that the system was able to produce results matching various ground geophysical techniques so several systems were built and deployed to map the entire country of Denmark. During that time the technical team had the opportunity to work with the users of the data. They received valuable feedback and identified areas for system improvement and set further R&D objectives. After collecting, processing and analyzing many thousands of kilometres of data and gaining many years of operational experience the SkyTEM team decided to make their breakthrough technology available to the world. The first commercial SkyTEM survey was performed in 2003 and SkyTEM Surveys ApS was officially launched in April 2004.\n2005 saw the first SkyTEM surveys for mineral exploration in Canada and Scandinavia. Since then development of systems continued and SkyTEM now offers systems that are capable of mapping to depths of over 500 m, or as shallow as the top few metres, depending on the application and targets sought. SkyTEM technology has been successfully applied globally for locating drill targets for a variety of economic mineral deposits, including gold, copper, nickel, platinum, uranium and coal.\nSkyTEM\u2019s mapping abilities have also been recognized by engineers, scientists and others with a need to accurately map the subsurface. The SkyTEM method has been called upon to locate water on a Galapagos Island, characterize a pipeline construction route, study slope stability on Mt. St Helens, identify contaminant pathways, map salt water intrusion, verify conditions for a planned CO2 sequestration site and a wide range of geotechnical engineering studies. SkyTEM is the first helicopter-borne geophysical method to be used in Antarctica. Scientists working on that project noted the system\u2019s ability to map the hidden distribution of ice and water on the frozen continent and stated that the SkyTEM Method provided more knowledge about the subsurface of Antarctica than 40 years of drilling and traditional geological studies.\nThe SkyTEM R&D team are constantly improving the system and are working towards the next breakthrough in the collection and processing of accurate high resolution geophysical data."}]}, {"name": "Pipe2CAD", "description": "Pipe2CAD is an AutoCAD add-on freeware for pipe network design that is used to carry out pipe interference check, and produce well formatted plan views and longitudinal profiles, ready for submission!\r\nPipe2CAD can import network data from hydraulic modeling applications in several formats including text files, shapefiles, and epanet (*.inp).

From our beginnings as a service and repair shop for refrigeration equipment to our current position as one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of refrigeration components and systems. G\u00fcntner has acquired a wealth of experience throughout this field, experience that provides benefit to our customers during consultation, planning and implementation.\nn 1931 in Munich, Germany, Hans G\u00fcntner established a repair service specializing in refrigeration equipment. After the war, in addition to continuing to offer repair service, the company increasingly focused on producing its own refrigeration system components. The need for components for refrigeration systems continued to increase and so, over the years, the company eventually grew to be a very successful mid-sized enterprise. Soon the original workshop in Munich became too small. As a result, in 1950 the company moved into larger facilities in nearby Germering. At the start of the 1980\u2019s, the company then moved to its current location in F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck, farther out from Munich.\nTo meet the ever-growing demand for refrigeration equipment on the European market, in 1990 G\u00fcntner formed a partnership with the Hungarian refrigeration company H\u00fct\u00f6technik. This joint venture started operations in the G\u00fcntner Tata production plant in Tata, Hungary. In 2003, G\u00fcntner purchased its Hungarian partner and the G\u00fcntner Tata facility was integrated into the overall G\u00fcntner Group. Today, in fact, the production plant in Tata is the largest one within the G\u00fcntner Group. It was at this plant in 2008, that two new production lines were set up for G\u00fcntner\u2019s innovative microox\u00ae technology.\nIn 1990, G\u00fcntner Elektronik, today known as G\u00fcntner Controls, was founded. This company division, located near Bielefeld, Germany produces controllers and switch cabinets for the international market. These controllers and cabinets, which are optimized for use with G\u00fcntner heat exchangers, are sold through all locations of the G\u00fcntner Group worldwide.\nSince 1996, G\u00fcntner production facilities in Indonesia have made top-quality finned heat exchangers for the Asian market. A complete, well-rounded, experienced team of engineers in the Development and Sales departments handles all customer inquiries and orders. This local approach allows them to best meet the special requirements of the broad Asian market.\nIn 2002, G\u00fcntner de M\u00e9xico (Monterrey) was the first G\u00fcntner production facility to be founded in the Americas. In Monterrey, G\u00fcntner manufactures top-quality heat exchangers and UL-approved switch cabinets for the entire American market. Since production started in Monterrey in 2002, the size of the production facility there has almost doubled in a successful effort to best meet the specific demands of this extensive market. To be able to meet the special demands of the North American market, a G\u00fcntner sales office exists in the United States since 2001.\nThe opening of G\u00fcntner do Brasil in 2008 marked yet another important step in serving the Americas. In doing so, the G\u00fcntner Group has expanded and strengthened its presence in the South American market. The location in Brazil produces evaporative condensers, air-cooled condensers and evaporators for the American markets."}, {"title": "Company Profile", "description": "In our more than 80-year corporate history, we always followed our Vision and Mission striving to achieve highest customer satisfaction.

These R&D efforts not only cover product design, thermodynamic calculation and testing but also software development and product-data management.\nAt G\u00fcntner, development of new processes is based on a clearly defined product development workflow. Each development is first preceded by a preliminary study during which fundamental questions with respect to market requirements and technical feasibility are examined and resolved.\nThermodynamic Design\nAll new development work usually starts by preparing a thermodynamic model. In preparing this design study, G\u00fcntner uses the most modern industry-wide software tools and even uses its own specially developed software.\nDesign\nAs soon as the fundamental thermodynamic characteristics for a new product model series have been established, the first design drawings are prepared. During the design development phase, the feasibility is also tested and possible solutions are compared and contrasted based on value analyses.\nPrototyping\nDespite their clear benefits, even the most modern computer programs cannot replace practical testing. The first product prototypes are built and tested during the design phase. The only devices that are actually manufactured are those that have first proven themselves during this comprehensive practical testing.Prototype EvaluationAll new product designs are examined in our test facilities to determine their actual technical properties and features. This work is done in our own internal testing department equipped with its own modern measurement chambers and instruments. As a Eurovent-certified company, we guarantee that the specified performance values can actually be achieved and that the desired sound pressure levels are met.Series ProductionOnly after all the technical testing has yielded the desired results do our design teams begin preparing the final drawings and schematics. Each new product requires its own set of drawings, in particular detailed section drawings. Our data management system makes these drawings available to all of our locations worldwide so that a given product can be made in any one of our production facilities.\nG\u00fcntner Group has its own internal research and testing department. There\u2019s a real need for this capability, for without measuring their actual performance, reliable statements about the critical properties of finned heat exchangers, such as their thermal performance, pressure drop or noise levels are essentially impossible. Without such testing, these properties can be known only to a limited or just a very rough extent. Having our own in-house testing facilities means that we can handle both large, longer research projects as well as shorter, experimental testing sessions intended to answer specific technical questions.Both examinations are done in close cooperation with the technical department concerned. One of the biggest advantages of having our own internal testing department is that it allows us to quickly employ the newly gained knowledge, expand on it and immediately apply it to our development work, bringing about immediate improvements in our products. The technical capabilities of our research and testing department allow us to conduct both broadly defined and application-specific investigations as well as examine the actual feasibility of special customer requirements.In all cases, we\u2019re able to derive a reliable basis for technically implementing the results. This process capability allows us to continuously improve the performance and features of our products, thus ensuring the greatest customer satisfaction.\nPerformance testing, material-combination testing and special projects\nOur primary work involves conducting performance testing of evaporators and condensers as well as heat exchangers for use with various fluids. To be able to examine a broad range of performances, we have measurement chambers available in different sizes & capacities. Our measurement setups and accuracies are in full compliance with the following industrial standards: EN 327, EN 328 and DIN 1048.\nWe also have a special test facility that allows us to investigate the cooling performance of evaporators in real-world applications and under extreme operating conditions. In addition, we conduct detailed examinations of various material combinations for different unit models.\nBeyond this, special research assignments from all sectors involved in heat transfer technology are accepted and treated in our test facility. In short, we're able to find solutions even for very special applications."}, {"title": "Sustainability", "description": "Careful use of resources in all our processes and an awareness of our responsibility to the environment are constant factors in shaping our sustainable business practices.

Lowering tapes down the well can be challenging. The tapes get caught and hungup on wires and pipes. They get false indications from cascading water and condensation. And it is labor intensive reeling the tapes down and back up. Then there are the decontamination issues. Pushing a tape down a crooked or sloped well can be nearly impossible. The submersible pressure transducers have similar issues with the added uncertainty about their location and reliability.Then there are the acoustic or sonic devices which send sound pulses into the well. While they are very convenient and fast, they are susceptable to imperfections in the well such as open perforations, open fissures or pockets, or even pipe fittings on the drop pipe, all of which can cause incorrect readings.The bottom line is that there is not a perfect solution for every well. But where the tape may not be able to fall into a sloped well, the sound pulse has no problems. And where the sound pulse is lost in an open fissure, the tape may go right past.While the submersible technologies have been well established, the acoustic or sonic meters have left room for improvement. This is where our story begins.One of the biggest problems with the sonic meters is that the sound pulses tend to travel in straight lines and reflect off any imperfection in its path. The degree to which it does so is a function of the sound frequency. The higher the frequency, the more directional the beam, and the smaller the obstruction that will reflect the sound. Ultrasonic detectors are commonly used for measuring streams from bridges and levels in tanks through open air. This is possible because the very high frequency sound travels as a beam in the direction it is launched. It is also able to detect small objects crossing the beam. It cannot detect the water level through a pipe, however, because the ultrasonic beam takes many paths through the pipe. A very small part of the beam travels straight through the pipe, while part takes one bounce off the wall, and some may bounce 20 times making the path much longer. This is combined with the reflections from every pipe seam and wire bend in the pipe. The net result is noise."}, {"title": "Other sonic meters have been developed for measuri...", "description": "Other sonic meters have been developed for measuring through pipes using a much lower frequency sound close to 200hz. At this frequency, the sound waves spread out and pretty much fill the space available to them. This makes it unsuitable for measuring a stream level from a bridge or level in a tank for example. But when confined to a pipe, the wave fills the pipe and travels as a single wave, eliminating the multipath issue with the ultrasonic waves.\nBut even at this frequency, small imperfections cause a significant portion of the sound pulse to be reflected and can appear like it has reflected off the water. Here is where Eno Scientific has taken this sonic technology to the next level. The Eno Scientific Well Sounders were developed to use an even lower frequency, down to 50hz. At these frequencies, the sound pulse acts more like you would expect from an air pressure wave. At these slow speeds, the air fills all the space along the route flowing around obstacles. The reflections from most pipe couplings and minor obstructions become insignificant.\nWhy doesn't everyone do it this way? The advantages are obvious. The answer is that it is much harder to do. Generating a clean low frequency pulse is more difficult. It is also much more difficult to determine the exact location of a slowly changing pressure wave than a quick one. Eno Scientific was able to solve these problems using powerful digital signal processing techniques and electronics."}, {"title": "Not only has Eno Scientific raised the bar in its ...", "description": "Not only has Eno Scientific raised the bar in its ability to use very low frequency pulses to measure the depth to the water, but also in the standard features included to make the users job easier.

The establishment of additional sales offices in Europe, including the UK and Italy, continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s.\u00a0In 1969, during the 25th anniversary of the discovery of EPR in Kazan Russia, Bruker announced further expansion into what was then the USSR. A new office was also established in Israel, further strengthening an already-established relationship with the Weizman Institute.\u00a0By 1972, Bruker\u2019s expansion had reached Australia, and in 1975 Bruker arrived in China, where a successful appearance at the Swiss Industrial Exhibition in Beijing resulted in the immediate sale of two WH 90 systems\u2014the first FT-only NMR spectrometers. South Korea and Taiwan sales offices soon followed, and in 1976 Bruker opened its first facility in Japan. Bruker was also successful in South America, with the first instrument installations taking place in Venezuela.\u00a0During this time of rapid global expansion, it became apparent that further growth in the market of analytical instrumentation would require the expansion into additional and new analytical technologies.\nBruker\u2019s already established strengths in NMR naturally led to developments in the field of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\u00a0 Bruker Medizintechnik (Medical) GmbH was formed in 1976, initially offering a range of mobile defibrillators.\u00a0 Later in the decade, Bruker had developed and was producing NMR-based tomography systems for use in clinical and pre-clinical applications, leading eventually to whole-body clinical MRI instrumentation.\nOver time, Bruker chose to shift its focus towards pre-clinical systems and became Bruker BioSpin MRI, the currently market leader in the field.\u00a0In 1977 \u201cDr. Franzen Analysentechnik\u201d was founded in Bremen as a spin-off company from Atlas MAT. A few years later, in 1980, Bruker acquired this company and renamed it \u201cBruker-Franzen Analytik\u201d, adding robust quadrupole mass spectrometers to the Bruker portfolio. That same year the first mobile detection system, the MM1, proved successful in both the civilian and military markets. In 1997 Bruker-Franzen Analytik GmbH was renamed Bruker Daltonik GmbH. The name was chosen to honor John Dalton for his work in formulating the theory of the atomic structure of matter. The development of two new ionization procedures in the late 1980s, electrospray and MALDI, enabled the ionization and analysis of biomolecules. This paved the way for the application of mass spectrometry in molecular biology and molecular medicine.

This value is \u201cPassion for Results\u201d. We are of course not only thinking about our financial result, although we naturally keep a close eye on this. But results are also more qualitative, such as Customer or Employee Satisfaction. It is operational efficiency such as On Time Deliveries. It is developing new products on time and budget. It is providing our employees with learning opportunities to meet their development needs. All employees in Munters have clear goals \u2013 that is how we maintain our focus on results.\nAnd our fourth Core Value is the natural extension of our result orientation. Because when we have achieved the level we want to reach, then we want to become better. This is how we always try to stay ahead of competition, of being the preferred partner to all with whom we work. We believe strongly that \u201cThere is always a better way\u201d; a way to improve what at first may look like the perfect way. We are convinced that if employees every day look at what they do and think \u201cthere is probably a better way to do this\u201d, we will always have an advantage on competition.

Volatile chemicals produce vapours at room temperature. Organic is a chemical containing carbon atoms. Volatile Organic Compounds include industrial chemicals, solvents, alcohols, and also petroleum products such as\u00a0 gasoline. VOC's combine with sunlight to form atmospheric ozone, or smog."}, {"title": "What is Zeolite?", "description": "Zeolite is a naturally occurring mineral, in crystal form. Natural zeolite is made of hydrous aluminium silicates of sodium, calcium, potassium or barium ions.\nNatural zeolite is hydrophilic (water loving) and readily adsorbs and desorbs water. More recently, synthetic zeolites have been developed for commercial applications. Over 70 types of synthetic zeolites have been created. Hydrophobic zeolite is an inorganic, stable crystal with properties suited to adsorbing VOC\u2019s. The zeolite's inert properties mean that it does not promote chemical reactions and will not even react with strong acids. It is also non-flammable to extreme temperatures."}, {"title": "How Do Zeolites Work?", "description": "The basic molecular structure of a zeolite is a tetrahedron or pyramid, formed by silicon oxides (SiOn). The tetrahedron has one silicon atom in the center and oxygen at each of the corners. The tetrahedral zeolites are linked together by oxygen atoms. Linked zeolites form pores, the size of which are determined by how many zeolite molecules are linked together.\nDepending of the number of linkages and which alkali ions are present in the crystal structure, several types of zeolites are formed, all with different pore sizes. The size of the pores also determines which VOC\u2019s can be adsorbed.\nMunters Zeol uses a mixture of hydrophobic zeolites with different pore sizes. This mixture allows a wide range of organic solvents to be adsorbed. In fact, most commercially available solvents are adsorbed by these hydrophobic zeolites.\nA VOC is attracted and held in the zeolite pore by a weak attractive force. This weak physical attractive force between chemically neutral compounds is known as the van der Waals force. The VOC will remain in the pore until it heated, at which time the VOC will be released from the zeolite into the air.\nWhen VOC laden air flows past zeolite molecules, the zeolite acts as a reverse filter or molecular sieve, capturing the compounds which are able to adsorb and allowing the compounds that are too large to flow past."}, {"title": "Zeolite and the HoneyCombe Rotor", "description": "Munters Zeol combined the hydrophobic zeolite technology with its HoneyCombe rotor technology. A system was created that can operate continuously with constant adsorption and desorption, has a low pressure drop, and maximized the surface area. One square foot of HoneyCombe media has a surface area of 492,480 ft2 ( 45,753 m2).HoneyCombe rotors were developed over 40 years ago by Munters. Munters is the world\u2019s leading supplier of process systems using HoneyCombe rotors for dehumidification, heat exchange, and VOC abatement. Munters\u2019 HoneyCombe rotors have numerous benefits. Rotors allow for high air flow, truly continuous operation. With a low pressure drop rotors have stable outlet conditions. The hydrophobic zeolite is permanently bonded with the HoneyCombe rotor therefore no attrition of the zeolite occurs. Munters HoneyCombe rotors are manufactured at the ISO 9001 certified facility in Amesbury, Massachusetts. The rotors are manufactured from a corrugated mineral fiber substrate permanently bonded with a proprietary mixture of hydrophobic zeolite and inorganic materials. The hydrophobic zeolite rotor is inorganic, completely inert and has rigidity, physical integrity and the ability to withstand thermal stress. The permanently bonded hydrophobic zeolite is an integral part of the HoneyCombe matrix and will not be leached out or removed physically or chemically."}, {"title": "How a Munters Zeol Rotor Concentrator Works", "description": "As a low concentration VOC laden air stream enters the hydrophobic Zeolite HoneyCombe rotor the air passes through the HoneyCombe media. The rotor turns several revolutions per hour continuously transporting VOC laden zeolite back into the regeneration sector and regenerated zeolite into the process section. In the process section the VOCs are adsorbed onto the zeolite and the clean air is exhausted to the atmosphere.In an isolated section, a small, hot stream of clean air is drawn through the rotor. This stream is normally only 5\u201310% of the process volume. The hot air desorbs the VOCs from the zeolite forming a concentrated VOC laden air stream. The regenerated zeolite is returned to the process.The concentrated stream is sent to a small oxidizer. The oxidizer converts the VOCs to carbon dioxide and water vapor which are exhausted to the atmosphere. The energy content of the VOCs contributes to the oxidation process further reducing the fuel requirement.The concentrated VOC stream can also be sent to alternate technologies, such as a condenser which recovers the VOCs for potential reuse, or a biofilter."}, {"title": "Overview:", "description": "Munters is a global leader in energy efficient and sustainable air treatment and climate solutions.

As the first global environmental union, it brought together governments and civil society organisations with a shared goal to protect nature. Its aim was to encourage international cooperation and provide scientific knowledge and tools to guide conservation action.\nDuring the first decade of its existence, IUCN\u2019s primary focus was to examine the impact of human activities on nature. It flagged the damaging effects of pesticides on biodiversity, and promoted the use of environmental impact assessments, which have since become the norm across sectors and industries.\nMuch of IUCN\u2019s subsequent work in the 1960s and 1970s was devoted to the protection of species and the habitats necessary for their survival. In 1964, IUCN established the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, which has since evolved into the world\u2019s most comprehensive data source on the global extinction risk of species.\nIUCN also played a fundamental role in the creation of key international conventions, including the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (1971), the World Heritage Convention (1972), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, (1974) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992).\nIn 1980, IUCN \u2013 in partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) \u2013 published the\u00a0World Conservation Strategy, a ground-breaking document which helped define the concept of \u2018sustainable development\u2019 and shaped the global conservation and sustainable development agenda.\nA subsequent version of the strategy,\u00a0Caring for the Earth,\u00a0was published by the three organisations in the run-up to the 1992 Earth Summit. It served as the basis for international environmental policy and guided the creation of the Rio Conventions on biodiversity (CBD), climate change (UNFCCC) and desertification (UNCCD).\nIn 1999, as environmental issues continued to gain importance at the international stage, IUCN was granted official observer status to the United Nations. Today it remains the only environmental organisation with such status.\nIn the early 2000s, IUCN developed its business engagement strategy. Prioritising sectors with a significant impact on nature and livelihoods, such as mining and oil and gas, its aim is to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable.\nLater in the 2000s, IUCN pioneered \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 \u2013 actions to conserve nature which also address global challenges, such as food and water security, climate change and poverty reduction.\nToday, with the expertise and reach of its more than 1,300 Members \u2013 including States, government agencies, NGOs and Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Organisations \u2013 and over 10,000 international experts, IUCN is the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network.

In 1983, Palintest became a part of the global Halma plc Group.\nThe company can be traced back to the late nineteenth century when two chemists called Wilkinson & Simpson became involved in an apothecary business in Newcastle on Tyne. This business continued to thrive and develop in Newcastle on Tyne and eventually became a manufacturing chemist and pharmaceutical wholesaling business.\nThis business continued to the 1950\u2019s until the Company was approached by Dr Thomas Palin, a water scientist and chemist whose achievements included the development of breakpoint chlorination for water and the invention of the DPD method for the determination of chlorine.\nDr Palin\u2019s method became the standard method of chlorine determination throughout the world. Dr Palin also developed a system of chemical reagents presented in the form of reagent tablets and intended for use in the determination of chemical constituents of drinking water. He approached Wilkinson & Simpson Ltd to manufacture the reagent tablets and Dr Palin and the Company formed a partnership.\nEventually Wilkinson & Simpson Ltd became sole owners of the tablet reagent system developed by Dr Palin and Dr Palin became a consultant to the Company. During the 1970\u2019s the pharmaceutical and wholesaling and manufacturing business was sold and the Company's business became exclusively that of chemical reagent manufacture.\nIn 1983 the Company Wilkinson & Simpson Ltd was purchased by a British Corporation, Halma plc and considerable investment was made in Wilkinson & Simpson Ltd to improve the manufacturing process of its tablet reagent system and to develop a complete range of analytical equipment to be used in association with the reagent tablets. The reagents were marketed under the brand name \u2018Palintest\u2019.\nThe Company was renamed \u2018Palintest Ltd\u2019 in May 1989 to reflect both its registered trade mark and its association with Dr Palin, the father of the DPD method.\n"}, {"title": "Capabilities", "description": "To continue our long history of innovation and support our global customer base, Palintest applies a number of key skills and capabilities:"}, {"title": "Wagtech", "description": "In 2011, Palintest Ltd acquired the water testing division of Wagtech International.Initially christened \u2018Wagtech Water Technology Division\u2019 (or WTD for short) following acquisition, this key part of Palintest\u2019s international business has a critical focus on the aid and developing world sector and the crucial part water and sanitation (WATSAN) have to play in the improvement of lives and protection of the environment.

We turn on the shower, the kitchen faucet, and the garden hose and out pours an endless supply of fresh, clean water. What many of us may not realize, though, is that our water supply is not a never end supply and it is not as clean as it may appear. Chlorine is popularly used but it is unable to effectively treat some of the harmful bacteria found in the water. Exposure to certain harmful bacteria can cause severe gastrointestinal illness and even death among people with compromised immune systems.Ultraviolet (UV) technology is more effective than chemicals in destroying certain waterborne contaminants without altering the taste of water. This makes it a practical process for treating water used for drinking and food preparation.Treating our water supply by the use of UV disinfection is not only more effective than traditional treatments, but it is also an environmental responsible way of treating our water. There are no disinfection by-products with the use of UV which is safe and chemical free. Plus, UV does not alter water chemistry and its constituents, such as pH, taste, odor, or colour.Purchasing a UV disinfection system for your home has a capital low cost as well as a low operational cost. The energy used by a UV disinfection system in an average size home is comparable to the same energy used by a 40-watt bulb!"}, {"title": "Why Trust Viqua?", "description": "VIQUA is a company dedicated to providing you and your family with safe and clean water.

Reduce Waste. Reduce Impact.Eagle International has a goal to reduce the global impact of tire waste on our environment. We build our tire recycling machines with quality materials and put them through rigorous testing. Since 1991, Eagle International has been the leading manufacturer of tire cutting and recycling equipment.\nTires are designed to be durable and long-lasting; this means that they are also difficult to recycle. It is a problem that persists across the globe, even in the midst of a recycling revolution. One of the barriers preventing a circular economy around tires are quantities \u2013 almost 3 million tires are discarded in the United States alone, annually.\n\u201cTake them to the landfill,\u201d you say? Sure, but most landfills require you to cut a tire into at least three sections before accepting it. When buried, tires trap methane gasses inside of them and tend to work their way up toward the surface. This causes problems at landfills because they take up excessive amounts of space and tear through liners that are meant to stop hazardous chemicals from leaching into the ground. \u201cCan\u2019t you burn the tires?\u201d Burning tires in an uncontrolled environment releases toxic compounds into the air.\nSo, what can we do with all of these tires? There are processes in place that cut, slice, and bale tires for use in other industries. This is where Eagle International steps in.

Tires are put through a grating machine that chunks them into various sizes of crumble. The smaller the crumble, the more times it needs to be shredded. Crumb rubber is used in artificial turf, road work, running track surfacing, ground cover for playgrounds, and non-decomposing mulch.\nShredding machines can take a beating from tire stocks. Blades wear down from the large tires and amounts of steel that are pushed through the machine. Eagle equipment reduces the size of tires by cutting them into more manageable sizes. We also build a line of debeaders that will cleanly pull the steel bead from the tire \u2013 yet another piece of the tire that can be recycled.\nDownsizing the tire also allows shredding companies to accept larger tire sizes, broadening the range of tires that can be shredded by one machine.\nBenefits of downsizing before shredding:"}, {"title": "Pyrolysis", "description": "We mentioned burning tires as an unacceptable option at the top of this article. However, there is a safe way to do it that requires special facilities. Pyrolysis is a process that burns the tire in a controlled, oxygen-free environment that allows the molecules in the tire to break down into four products: oil, syngas, steel, and recovered carbon black (RCB). The oil can be refined and blended with diesel fuel, syngas is used as the fuel for the pyrolysis process, steel can be recycled, and RCB is used in various black rubber and plastic products.Benefits to downsizing before pyrolysis:\nAs you can see, there are a variety of avenues for recycling tires and Eagle manufactures machines that can help accomplish your goals.

Because of the high erosion resistance, can even be used for slopes up to 10 m/sec., without any danger of material deterioration, Vitrified clay is the only material that resists regular rinsing and unclogging by means of high water pressure techniques. This means that vitrified clay pipe canals can be written down (off) over a longer period and that maintenance, renovation and replacement costs can be limited to a much lower level, Vitrified clay has high abrasion resistance which is equally true for the glaze and the rest of the wall and resistant to all types of chemicals over the entire wall thickness, also has a low heat expansion coefficient and Environmental friendly.\nCIPAC annual capacity is around 35 thousand tons, pipes length from 1.5 to 2 meters, pipes diameters from 100 mm up to 1000 mm, produced according the project specifications.Properties of Vitrified PipesVitrified clay pipes and fittings are produced from the raw materials clay, grog and water. The glaze applied to the products before firing consists of mainly the same basic components plus metallic oxides for color. During drying most of the water necessary for shaping is extracted. The subsequent firing at very high temperatures creates a completely new material by sintering.\nThis vitrified clay has exceptional properties in respect to chemical resistance, mechanical strength, impermeability and hardness.Highly developed manufacturing and preparation techniques have made it possible to upgrade an already proven product, the consistency is guaranteed by quality control system according to Quality Certificate ISO 9001:2008, Environmental Friendly Certificate ISO 14001:2004 and Safety and Occupational Health Certificate OHSAS 18001:2007.\nVitrified clay pipes are designed for sewers operating on gravity in municipal and industrial applications.\nCIPAC pipes are manufactured to a harmonized standards which specifies requirements for vitrified clay pipes and fittings with flexible joints for drains and sewers.\nBiological Induced H\u2082S\u00a0Corrosion The formation of H\u2082S\u00a0in sewage is a consequence of the natural biological decomposition of sulphur containing organic and inorganic matter.H\u2082S mainly forms under anaerobic conditions by sulphate reducing bacteria in the slime of a matured sewer and to a lesser extent by bacteriological processes in the sewage.In gravity sewers the formation of H\u2082S\u00a0commences after the oxygen originally present in the sewage has been consumed by manifold biological processes.This is followed by the anaerobic decomposition with an ever increasing formation of H\u2082S, which slowly escapes into the sewer atmosphere.Turbulence in the sewage stream increases the escape of the gaseous H\u2082S.The formation of H\u2082S\u00a0is supported by long sewage flows, low flow velocities and high sewage temperatures.\n"}]}, {"name": "Hy-Classe Training", "description": "Hy-Classe Training provides unrivaled Training Courses in Safety, Health, Environment and Quality for the Oil and Gas, Aviation and Telecommunication companies in Cameroon, Congo, Chad, Gabon and all over Central and West Africa.

Potter held exclusive patents on the design of the turbine flowmeter. Potter Aeronautical began licensing the turbine flowmeter to other companies, both domestic and internationally. At the time Potter Aeronautical closed in 1968, its\u2019 production manager was young engineer named Ken Hoffer. Ken then founded his own turbine flowmeter company\u2026Hoffer Flow Controls.   For the first ten years in business Hoffer Flow Controls specialized in cryogenic flow measurement systems. Hoffer pioneered the use of the turbine flowmeter in cryogenics.  During the late 1970's we began to diversify into other markets, including oil patch, chemical and petrochemical, aerospace and energy measurement. More recently, we have introduced our products to the European Common Market, Central and South America and the Far East, and have expanded our product line to include magnetic and ultrasonic style flowmeters.  A key feature in our high precision turbine flowmeter that differentiates them from other turbine flowmeters is the hybrid ceramic ball bearings. Designed to tolerate gas spinning during cool-down in any cryogenic fluid application, this type of bearing will far outlast all other types of open race bearings in any clean liquid or gas application. Open race ball bearings, as used by other manufacturers depend on the flowing fluid for lubricity therefore, open race bearings can fail quickly. Our flowmeter with the self-lubricating ceramic bearing will far outlast other turbine meters with conventional bearings.  Today Hoffer Flow Controls manufactures high precision turbine flowmeters, not only for the\u00a0 Hoffer Flow Controls pictured today cryogenic industry but is the world leader in turbine flowmeter technology for the measurement of clean liquids and gases throughout the processing industries.

Water as a limited resource can meet the needs of the society and nature by means of water reuse and the implementation of modern technologies.\nGaining access to water for domestic use \u2013 both drinking (potable) water and water for sanitation and washing \u2013 remains a challenge for many Namibians, especially those in rural communities. Having to source water from remote supplies each day creates a situation whereby time and energy are devoted to meeting a basic human need; where family members must spend many hours a day in just fetching water for use in the home this can have impacts on school attendance and the ability of women, in particular, to engage in income-generating activities. Where such supplies are of dubious quality or are unsustainable, the issues only multiply.\nFurthermore, those businesses/industries and institutions such as schools and healthcare facilities located outside water articulation networks struggle to operate effectively if they do not have a guaranteed drinking water supply or a safe way to dispose of their wastewater.\nThe Harambee Prosperity Plan sets out a number of large-scale activities designed to bring safe drinking water to 100 per cent the Namibian people by 2020 while at the same time monitoring the effectiveness of water management measures and enhancing water security. But as the recent drought years have shown us, there also needs to be a change in mind-set so that domestic and industrial water use becomes wise, rather than wasteful, and reflects the scarcity of this resource in an arid country such as ours.\nThe development of new technologies has seen the introduction of high-quality wastewater treatment and sanitation products into the Namibian market over the past few years. ECO Smart Water Technologies Namibia CC is a 100 per cent Namibian-owned Company that has introduced efficient, affordable and innovative wastewater treatment and sanitation solutions to Namibians, often in resource-poor environments.\nThe company provides products that meet the particular demands of both public and private sector clients and that comprise the following:\nAerobic wastewater treatment systems;\nSanitation systems that use recycled water; and\nGreywater filtration and recycling systems.\nECO Smart Water Technologies Namibia CC and the Namibian\u00a0Water Supply and Sanitation Policy\nAt Independence, Namibia inherited a two-tiered system of infrastructural development whereby those areas predominantly occupied by non-whites - communal land/rural communities and urban informal settlements - were neglected in respect to water supply and sewerage services.\nNamibia\u2019s Water Supply and Sanitation Policy (Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry, 2008) was subsequently developed to outline clear operational strategies for guaranteeing safe and affordable water supply and sanitation services and encouraging decentralised sanitation systems where appropriate. The strategy also promotes:\n\u201c\u2026.recycling through safe and hygienic recovery and use of nutrients, organics, trace elements, water and energy or the safe disposal of all human and other wastes, including sewage and industrial effluent, in an environmentally sustainable fashion.\u201d\nECO Smart Water Technologies Namibia CC responded to this call through its range of products designed for use in those environments that have been previously underserved with respect to water articulation and wastewater treatment. Our safe and affordable sanitation solutions for informal settlements and rural communities in Namibia (described in detail below) have contributed towards the establishment of more dignified and hygienic homes, workplaces, and public institutions."}]}, {"name": "Biopipe Global Corp.", "description": "Biopipe Global is an innovative onsite NO sludge biological wastewater treatment and water recycling company.

Fermi, 7, San Bonifacio (VR), Veneto 37047 Italy", "details": {"Business Type": "Manufacturer", "Industry Type": "Pumps & Pumping", "Market Focus": "Globally (various continents)"}, "panels": [{"title": "The history and development of an ethical enterprise", "description": "Back then the metropolis on the Persian Gulf was only a small town and no one could have imagined that that sand would bloom until it sprouted one of the most luxurious capitals in the world. Pedrollo met businessmen and officials of the Arab country and explained to them that, thanks to pumps, Water could gush forth from the desert. One of the most important electric pump manufacturers in the world had been born, with a commitment that it has always stood by: the future of the Pedrollo company would be to collaborate on the solution to the water problem.\nPedrollo\u2019s market developed in just a few years: after Dubai the company made itself known throughout the Middle East. Then came Latin America, Africa... And then Bangladesh, where Silvano Pedrollo met a man who asked him to design\u00a0an inexpensive, low-consumption pump\u00a0that he would sell by the thousands. They built one that cost as much as a couple of pizzas and sent him enough of them for a province: peasants no longer had to depend on the rains, and that year the rice crop was more plentiful than it had ever been.\u00a0The value of water had become real, concrete, and since then water installations are considered a primary good.\nFor almost 40 years the Pedrollo group has been growing world-wide and continues to design and build pumps that help carry water where it is most needed.\u00a0Where water pours forth, colour returns to the landscape and hope springs anew. With each well the most parched lands recover vigour. In the same way, Pedrollo believes that to bear fruit,\u00a0solidarity is a commitment that has to be cultivated every day. Today more than ever companies need to have a social purpose, and feel the responsibility of doing their part to change the world, to help people and their countries grow."}, {"title": "Philosophy", "description": "Our philosophy? The respect for the man.\nThe Pedrollo brand is present with its products in over 160 countries around the world and testifies everywhere to the best values of Italian entrepreneurship, where\u00a0quality and reliability\u00a0stand out. Requisites undoubtedly important from a commercial standpoint, and yet also simple expressions of\u00a0a loftier value that has always inspired the company\u2019s activities: respect for people.\nTo demonstrate the concreteness of this ethical orientation, Pedrollo has chosen to apply particularly advantageous terms of sale in the conviction that water isn\u2019t an ordinary merchandise to draw profit from but\u00a0a special resource that must be guaranteed to everyone. In this way the company tangibly manifests a form of sincere respect towards those most in need of solidarity and attention.   Pedrollo also designs and manufactures the best possible product in terms of efficiency, reliability and guaranteed originality: a result it strives for through the continuing commitment of its\u00a0research and development division. It is precisely to ensure the constant improvement of its processes and products that, ever since its founding, Pedrollo SpA has\u00a0invested all the profits generated by its activity back into the company. This, too, is a real form of respect: towards customers and suppliers.  Respect, therefore, is the true cornerstone of the Pedrollo philosophy: a deliberate choice that was already made at the time the company was formed in 1974, and that made it, nearly 40 years ahead of its time, a concrete example of a company attentive to social responsibility, an orientation that only now is beginning to spread."}, {"title": "Innovation", "description": "More and more, innovation is playing a leading role in the electric pump sector. Water extraction and conveyance processes pose obstacles of various kinds that require increasingly original solutions linked to electronics, mechanics, and the use of advanced materials. The success that Pedrollo attains all over the world is explained by its great capacity for innovation, backed up by constant research and a strong commitment to development. These efforts are primarily aimed at technical improvement of the plants, but not only.Once the functional priorities of the products are ensured, Pedrollo also makes regular updates on the design, an element that foreign manufacturers generally neglect but which is much appreciated on the market as a distinctive sign of Italian quality. The constant renewal of its products also on the aesthetic level, making them attractive as well as efficient, is a further indication of the all-round attention that Pedrollo devotes to its customers. Pedrollo also has a cutting-edge centre for the execution of prototypes, which makes it possible to quickly design and realise new products offering ever better performances and suited to the most diverse customer needs.Once the functional priorities of the products are ensured, Pedrollo also makes regular updates on the design, an element that foreign manufacturers generally neglect but which is much appreciated on the market as a distinctive sign of Italian quality.

Dust particles in the air have adverse effects on people, the environment and the equipment used to control it.The dust-control solutions developed by EmiControls generate a fine mist which dampens the dust, making it heavier and forcing it to the ground. It is essential for the water droplets to be small in size. Droplets of water, which are too big, such as those produced with a conventional hose, are inefficient at suppressing the dust: the available surface is smaller and the drops are heavier. Therefore they only remain in the air for a short time and this significantly reduces their dust-binding potential.When the water is atomized to very small droplets, a large surface area is created which is ideal for binding the dust particles. Therefore more dust can be tackled with less water.This principle is identical for all EmiControls dust-control systems \u2013 regardless of whether it is a mobile dust-laying sprayer, a stand-alone spray system or a complete system.OdorsUnpleasant odors are mainly encountered in recycling and composting plants. When attempting to combat odors in an efficient manner, it is not sufficient to simply mask the smell. It is more a case of needing to eliminate the molecules causing the foul smell. EmiControls offers two different solutions for deodorization.In the first case, a neutralizing biological additive is mixed with the finely atomized mist to combat the odor. It does not affect the natural decomposition process but merely neutralizes the unpleasant smell. The molecules carrying the unpleasant odor are bound by the compound, therefore the odor is no longer noticed.In the second case, bacteria is added to the mist, which both eliminate the smell and accelerate the decomposition process. This solution is also harmless to the environment.Both odor control solutions have proved to be extremely efficient and are used primarily in composting and recycling plants, material processing applications and biogas plants.Proven EffectivenessThe patented nozzle head by EmiControls sits inside the turbine and forms a very fine mist with a high level of protection from crosswinds, allowing it to bind almost every dust particle in the air. No additives are required in the dust-binding process. EmiControls products are also quiet enough for use in residential and urban areas. The software is user-friendly and with the simple push of a button or remote control the systems can be put into operation and controlled without delay.The wide range of dust control solutions and the variety of add-on installations for the systems allow maximum levels of efficiency. In special cases designs will be customized to meet individual requirements for efficient and highly effective solutions, like fixed spray installations. All the machines can be pivoted all the way around, and the remote control facility guarantees their simple and rapid operation, immediate adjustment to wind direction, temperature and humidity."}]}, {"name": "Aquila Recycling Industries", "description": "Aquila is the leading plastic recycling plant in Uganda.

People breathe every four seconds, that is roughly 22,000 breaths every day. In 24 hours, each of us breaths in about 15,000 liters of air.With every breath, large quantities of tiny particles enter our body. Even in presumably healthy rural air, there are millions of particles such as pollen, fungal spores, mold, soot, bacteria and viruses. In a large city, there are thousands of times as many particles, in the billions.3 millionFine dust is particularly insidious. Over three million people die every year from the consequences of heavy air pollution with fine dust. In comparison with fine dust, small grains of sand are gigantic boulders. When inhaled, fine dust enters into the deeper respiratory tract and sometimes even moves directly into the blood. Health alert! In vehicles and buildings, where we spend the majority of our time, the air is often much more contaminated than outdoors. Not to mention smoky indoor air with 100 billion particles per liter.This is why it is so reassuring that our filters and filter systems reliably separate the essential elements of life from the harmful pollutants. So that everyone can breath in deeply. With pure pleasure and a high quality of life!

At the time, Reverse Osmosis Desalination Systems were just becoming commercially feasible and available, yet only for large municipal plants. The President of Standard Communications, Donald Thomas, was a boating enthusiast, and after reading of this new technology to 'make water', he had the vision that this method of producing potable water could be used on small, individual systems for the boating industry. Back then the only means of producing potable water aboard a boat was to either catch rain or use bulky, unreliable and inefficient heat evaporation systems. Alternatively, boats had to carry water which inevitably ran out much too soon, and at inopportune times.  The boating industry owes its gratitude to Donald Thomas for his vision, direction, and leadership in presenting one of the most important innovations of this century to the boating world. Donald Thomas is the true pioneer of small scale Reverse Osmosis Desalinations Systems, and most favorably changed the boating industry over 29 years ago. Horizon Reverse Osmosis continues to operate with that pioneering, innovative spirit, and has evolved its product line into a unique style ideally suited for marine use. Horizon Reverse Osmosis continues today to hold a major share of the world market.  Sea Recovery Corporation obtained Horizon Reverse Osmosis in December of 1993, and today, Horizon Reverse Osmosis is a major product line of its mother company. The unique styling and separate distribution system that made Horizon Reverse Osmosis successful over the years are maintained and preserved today, and this allows Horizon Reverse Osmosis' uninhibited growth and development to continue its success as a highly regarded brand name in reverse osmosis desalination equipment.  The current Seafari line of marine watermakers enhances all that Horizon Reverse Osmosis stands for and has achieved in the water-making world. It's no wonder that Horizon Reverse Osmosis' customer confidence and satisfaction rank as the highest in the industry."}, {"title": "Company Background", "description": "Since 1975, HRO Systems and Village Marine have been pioneering the method of producing potable water for the boating industry.

Proper and thorough cleaning of bailer components prior to assembly is critical to manufacturing a quality bailer; that\u2019s why personnel wear powder-free nitrile gloves at each stage of the assembly process. All bailer components are cleaned pre-assembly with laboratory-grade, phosphate-free detergent and given a final rinse with de-ionized water before drying. The cleaning, drying and assembly processes are performed in three separate pressure-positive rooms to minimize the possibility of airborne contaminants. After assembly, each bailer is individually sealed within 3 mm polyethylene bags prior to boxing. Every case of bailers and slow-emptying devices (a.k.a., VOC Tips) is labeled with a 6-character quality code. This code allows Aqua Bailers to trace a manufactured product back to the actual day of production to ensure correction of any component quality issues that may arise.\u2003Testing. Aqua Bailers\u2019 product standards are defined by superior field performance and superior sample integrity. Superior field performance is tested via destructive examination (DE) and non-destructive examination (NDE). Prior to packaging, assembled bailers are randomly and periodically tested to ensure they can withstand rigorous field use. Environmental consultants charged with the responsibility of analyzing ground water for contaminant levels as (minimal as parts per billion) need assurance that the equipment they use will not affect the sample. Optimizing sample integrity requires periodic independent laboratory testing of randomly selected assembled, pre-packaged bailers. Since each sampling event may be unique, no one laboratory test covers every consultant\u2019s individual requirements. For example, Test Method 8260B is appropriate when testing for trace levels of volatile organic compounds, but does not include metals. Aqua Bailers periodically tests its bailers to ensure a below-detection-limit (BDL) result for a wide range of analytes including, but not limited to, all RCRA Priority I Pollutants. Contact Aqua Bailers directly for specific third-party test results.Warranty. Aqua Bailers\u2019 warranty obligation is limited to non-conforming goods. Products to be examined, repaired, or replaced will be returned to Aqua Bailer at our discretion. Products are not to be returned, nor will they be received, without express permission from Aqua Bailers prior to returning. Contact the office for details on returning defective products. Aqua Bailers\u2019 liability for replacement of non-conforming products is limited to and will not exceed the purchase price paid by the Purchaser."}]}, {"name": "IQPC Worldwide", "description": "IQPC provides business executives around the world with tailored practical conferences, large scale events, topical seminars and in-house training programs, keeping them up-to-date with industry trends, technological developments and the regulatory landscape.

In 2004 Leeman Labs was acquired by Teledyne technologies to augment Teledyne's existing laboratory and continuous monitoring instruments used in environmental applications, and complement Teledyne Tekmar's organic analysis instrumentation.\nToday, its instruments can be found conducting analyses across a broad spectrum of industries and sample types. The usefulness of Teledyne Leeman Lab's elemental analysis instrumentation ranges from agriculture to aerospace and forensics to food in over 50 countries.\nThe history of Teledyne Leeman Labs is filled with 'firsts' in Atomic Spectroscopy. But the past is not only about revolutionary moments, it is also about refinement.

Beckman, Ph.D, and brothers Wallace and Joseph Coulter.Beckman Coulter's commitment to innovation dates back to its origin in 1935 when Dr. Beckman sold the first commercial pH meter. Within 25 years, the pH meter and newly introduced DU spectrophotometer and helipot potentiometer found thousands of applications in science, industry and medicine.A series of acquisitions in the 1950s and 1960s complemented and expanded the business. The 1970s saw tremendous expansion in both products and facilities, with new sites in Europe and the opening of a sales unit in China. Operations in the 1980s and 1990s focused on developing laboratory systems for biological analysis and transforming technology into solutions for clinical labs. In 1996, the acquisition of the Access product line from Sanofi Diagnostics added immunoassay to the company's diagnostics product offering.

As TOMRA continues to expand globally, we recognize the importance of preparing for new challenges that we are likely to meet in our business activities."}, {"title": "Our History", "description": "TOMRA was founded on an innovation for return of empty beverage containers more than forty years ago. In a small shed in Asker, Norway, the brothers Petter and Tore Planke created a solution to a problem: a local grocer wanted a machine that could quickly and easily take back empty bottles. This was the beginning of TOMRA.\nOn April 1, 1972, TOMRA was officially founded by the Planke family. By the end of 1972, TOMRA had installed 29 machines in Norway. The success of those machines soon began to generate interest abroad. By 1973, TOMRA had entered into several distribution agreements for markets in Europe and the United States.\nFrom 1972 to 1976, TOMRA\u2019s revenues grew from 700,000 NOK to 6.9 million NOK. The first major sales breakthrough happened in 1974 when the Swedish state-owned wine retailer Systembolaget ordered 100 machines, specially adapted to the conveyor equipment that was already installed in their sales outlets.\nWhen the bottle recognition technology was released in 1977, growth really began to take off. The launch of the first self-programmable RVM, the Tomra SP, positioned TOMRA far ahead of competition and well prepared for the entry into the 1980s.\nAfter the stock listing in 1985, optimism ruled as TOMRA positioned itself for growth in the US. Macro-economic conditions wanted otherwise. The Soviet Union dumped millions of tons of aluminum on the world market in 1985, leading to a dramatic drop in the aluminum price. As the aluminum prices plummeted by over 60 percent in four months, there was little incentive left to recycle aluminum cans in non-deposit markets. The substantial financial losses suffered by TOMRA forced the company to abandon most of its US activities in 1986.\nDespite losses in the US, TOMRA\u2019s financial supporters still believed in the business potential of the company. From pre-tax losses of 129.6 million NOK in 1986, TOMRA bounced back to deliver a profit of 10.3 million NOK the year after. During this period, TOMRA returned to its roots, concentrating its efforts on solidifying its strong European position and maintaining its leading edge in product development.\nThe last three years of the 1980s saw TOMRA introduce its next generation RVM, the Tomra 300, revenues increase with 62 percent from 1987 to 1989, and a careful reentry into the US, generating a revenue of 12.1 million NOK in 1989.\nThe acquisition of material handling company NEROC in 1992 marked the entry into a new era. Before this acquisition, all of TOMRA\u2019s revenues had come from sales and service of RVMs. TOMRA now begun an effort to evolve its business model into the full container recycling value chain, which includes collection, pick-up, processing, material trading, recycling and production of new containers.\nDuring the 1990s, measures were taken to improve efficiency and reduce costs. While the most significant was the gathering of all production in the new headquarters in Norway, efforts were also begun to make the production assembly method more efficient by allowing for delivery of machine components only when an actual order was being prepared for assembly.\nIn the last five years of the decade, TOMRA\u2019s annual revenues increased from 501 million NOK to 2.1 billion NOK, representing an average annual increase of 46 percent. The most significant factor behind this growth was TOMRA\u2019s growing presence in the United States. By 1999, sales in the US accounted for more than half of total revenues.\nOn the technology side, a new milestone was reached in 1997 with the launch of the T600. Not since the launch of the Tomra SP in 1977 had the market been introduced to a greater leap in RVM technology. Incorporating a number of innovations including a new container recognition system, horizontal container in-feed, a built-in modem and an advanced graphics display, the T600 introduced a more versatile and user-friendly\u00a0 platform that could easily be configured to meet the need of the shop.\nBy the end of the decade, TOMRA had developed into a truly international corporation, with over 1700 employees working in 34 different countries and 46 separate markets.\nDuring the first 30 years of its history, TOMRA focused on growing reverse vending business in markets with deposit systems for beverage packaging. In 2000, the company saw that it would need to develop a more comprehensive business platform in order to meet its growth targets.\nEfforts included reverse vending projects in Japan and Brazil, but the most notable developments came through a number of strategic acquisitions: TiTech in 2004, the Orwak Group in 2005, Commodas in 2006 and Ultrasort in 2008. Revenues within this new segment of Industrial Processing Technology more than doubled from 379 million NOK in 2005, to 793 million NOK in 2008.\nThe major event of the decade was the implementation of a deposit system for non-refillable containers in Germany, which got TOMRA flying into the latter half of the period. In 2006, TOMRA delivered approximately 8,800 new reverse vending systems to Germany alone. That accounts for about thrice as much as total volume worldwide in a normal year at the time, and Germany has been a key market for TOMRA ever since.\nHaving worked on developing process analytics for the food industries with QVision, it was not a far-fetched idea for TOMRA to venture further into the food segment. The first acquisition of the decade, Odenberg, brought to the table unique, patented technology and leading market positions in several fast-growing segments of the food sorting and processing industry. With the acquisition of BEST Sorting in 2012, TOMRA gained a position as one of the world\u2019s leading food sorters and an expanded technology portfolio unrivalled by competitors.\nThrough a significant number of acquisitions, TOMRA had grown into a considerably global company since the first part of the 2000s. In order to galvanize the combined strength of the various subsidiaries, it was decided in 2010 that TOMRA would embark on a strategic process to gather all companies in the Group under one brand umbrella \u2013 TOMRA. As part of this strategic process, a new mission and vision was launched in 2012. The rebranding process was concluded in 2015."}]}, {"name": "Servomex - a Spectris Company", "description": "Servomex was founded in the United Kingdom in 1952 by three partners: Richard Steel, John Crockett and Ronald Mudie.

At first, he manufactured door locks, door handles, nameplates and sculptures for grave sites. After the First World War, Hermann Sewerin produced milk centrifuges ('G\u00fctersloh Sahna') and carburettors for cars and motorcycles ('Einhorn').Together with his brother Fritz, Hermann Sewerin manufactured a tobacco pipe called 'Sewerin's Vulkan (Volcano)', developed and patented by another of his brothers, Wilhelm. Hermann Sewerin established Vulkan-Werk GmbH to manufacture these pipes. The company was entered in the commercial register on 9 October 1923.The frequent mining disasters that took place at that time inspired Hermann Sewerin to develop a 'gas indicator for indicating mine gases'. The Reichspatentamt (State Patent Office) granted a patent for the gas indicator on 8 October 1931. This invention laid the foundation for the significance the company enjoys today. The 2nd generation - from trade production to industrial operation \u2026The company founder's three sons, Paul, Heinz and Willy Sewerin, joined the company in the early 1930s. In 1933 Paul Sewerin carried out the first systematic examination of a gas pipeline network by order of the Fulda Municipal Gas and Waterworks. The name 'Sewerin' became well known among gasworks. For this reason, on 30 December 1936, Vulkan-Werk GmbH became the Hermann Sewerin Company.When Hermann Sewerin died suddenly in 1941, his three sons continued to run the company. After the Second World War it developed from a trade production operation into an industrial company. The range of devices and services offered primarily to utility supply companies continued to expand as the years went by.The 3rd generation - innovation and change \u2026From the mid-1960s to the 1970s, the third generation joined the company: Peter Sewerin, the son of Willy Sewerin, and Hermann Sewerin, the son of Heinz Sewerin (\u20201975). Paul Sewerin died in 1980.When the company moved in 1991 to its new location on Robert-Bosch-Stra\u00dfe, not only was its appearance rejuvenated, but its organization was realigned with respect to the requirements of the next millennium. In 1998, after more than 60 years of service, Willy Sewerin retired.The 4th generation - globalisation and new markets ...The rapidly growing Chinese market has definitely opened and Sewerin has positioned itself in the 'Middle Kingdom' as a proven partner for gas and water suppliers. Dr. Swen Hermann Sewerin \u2013 son of Peter Sewerin and grandson of Willy Sewerin \u2013 has been with the company since July 2001 and became its CEO in August 2004.

Natural sources of mercury to air include the oceans, land, biomass burning and volcanoes.\u00a0 Since mercury is an element and cannot be destroyed, one big challenge for mercury scientists is to understand how much of mercury in the environment is due to anthropogenic sources.\u00a0 The major categories of anthropogenic sources of mercury to air are fossil fuel combustion (mainly coal), metal production, industrial and artisanal gold production, cement production, chlor-alkali industry and waste incineration.\u00a0 Annual average anthropogenic mercury emissions to air are estimated to be approximately 2000 tonnes (2000 megagrams/year), but may be up to nearly 3000 tones.\u00a0 Annual average natural emissions to air are estimated to be at least 2000 tonnes with the higher end estimates over 5000 tonnes.\nThe toxicity of mercury is largely dependent on the chemical form and the path of exposure. The most toxic form for dietary intake is methylmercury [CH3Hg]. Exposure of animals to methylmercury affects the immune system, alters genetic and enzyme systems, and damages the nervous system. Methylmercury is also a teratogen, which means it is particularly damaging to developing embryos, which are 5 to 10 times more sensitive than adults.\u00a0 The most toxic form for exposure through inhalation is elemental mercury (Hg0).\u00a0 At sufficient levels, continued inhalation exposure to elemental mercury causes tremors, gingivitis, and excitability.\u00a0 At very high levels, inhalation of elemental mercury can cause death.\u00a0 High levels of elemental mercury are usually confined to industrial settings or mercury spill events.\u00a0 Since elemental mercury is difficult to absorb in the digestive system, there is minimal effect from dietary intake.\nOnce present in aquatic ecosystems, elemental and inorganic mercury can undergo chemical transformations to methylated mercury species and enter the food web.\u00a0 Because methylmercury is not easily purged from organisms, biomagnification of up to 107 can occur in the aquatic food chain.\u00a0 Harm to upper level predators such as birds, sea mammals and humans can result when consuming tissues with high levels of methyl mercury (mainly fish).\u00a0 Acute exposure to high levels of methyl mercury contamination has been well documented in cases such as Minamata Bay, Japan in the 1950\u2019s and Iraq in the 1970s.\u00a0 Recent low-level exposure studies have been used to set government guidelines for methyl mercury consumption nationally and internationally.\u00a0 New studies also suggest that methyl mercury concentrations in rice are a potential concern.\nConsiderable effort has been spent trying to understand how mercury cycles through the environment.\u00a0 A major advancement in understanding began in the early 1990s when scientists began using new ultra-trace level mercury detection instruments, speciation methods and ultra-clean sampling techniques. Ice and sediment core records indicate that environmental mercury levels have increased substantially over pre-industrial levels. \u00a0Direct release of mercury to aquatic ecosystems has been dramatically reduced in Europe and North America, but continues to be an area of concern for emerging and developing countries.\u00a0 However, research has shown that atmospheric emission, dispersal, transformation and subsequent wet and dry deposition is the primary route for mercury contamination in remote aquatic ecosystems far removed from direct sources of contamination. The best control strategy to prevent biomagnification is to limit mercury releases to the environment. While not practical to control natural sources such as volcanoes and geological deposits, it is possible to control anthropogenic releases from activities such as manufacturing, mining, and power production.\u00a0 In the past 10 years, there has been an increased focus on developing mercury control policies and regulations at the national and international level.\u00a0 The increased global emphasis reducing mercury emissions and use provides support new control technology development, new and better monitoring equipment and advance research studies."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/metrohm-ag-1633", "id": "1633", "name": "Metrohm AG", "description": "Metrohm is a worldwide leading manufacturer of precision instruments for chemical analysis.

To do this, we improve the efficiency of the processes or adapt the processes to new tasks, for example tasks which we are set by our customers or which arise through statutory regulations.\nHere, the focus is constantly on diverse anaerobic technology applications as well as various bio-film processes, for example using Biomar\u00ae biological treatment processes.  In the field of Envochem\u00ae chemical-physical treatment processes, we are constantly working on the formulations of our water treatment products. Important topics here are the improvement of efficiency, the environmental impact and the development of formulations for new applications. All of our product ranges are continuously evaluated according to many different criteria, for example to improve flow conditions or the behaviour of membranes. Here we attach particular importance to cost-effectiveness, but also take account of energy and cleaning efficiency or process stability, as well as the robustness of the processes, for example.\nDissolved-air flotation optimised for water circulation systems\nThe injector system for dissolved-air plants, which has been newly developed by EnviroChemie, makes it possible to save operating costs because it is no longer mandatory for the cleaning results and the operation of the flotation plant to condition the water with chemicals.\nThe company has received German utility model protection for its specific dissolved-air flotation system from the Flomar\u00ae series. This modified version is, for example, suited to depleting the solids from highly polluted exhaust air purification wash cycles from washing towers or electrostatic precipitators. The task here is to reduce the pollutants from the cycles without substantial usage of salt and to thereby keep costs down. Complete clarification of the wastewater is not necessary.\nTraditional dissolved-air flotation systems produce the flotation motive water through air saturation of a partial flow in the plant outflow. The saturation usually takes place using multi-stage pumps, which only run smoothly if they are fed with pH-neutral wastewater that is mostly free from solids.\nThe injector system developed by EnviroChemie achieves micro-bubble formation comparable to saturation by pumps. The air saturation of the partial flow is carried out by an injector pressure container, which is fed by a wastewater pump resistant to solids. A multi-stage pump is then no longer required for the operation of the flotation. Both alkaline and acidic wastewater can be treated easily with the new system. As a result, cycles can be treated with the flotation plants without chemical conditioning or neutralisation. The flocculant dosage is only required to produce separable flocs. If floatable solids are also present without flocculation, a chemical-free procedure is possible.\nWe are continuously developing our processes for industrial water treatment\nUsing our own process technology laboratory with attached technology centre, we continuously develop our processes for water treatment, water recycling and wastewater treatment.\nWe develop new plants or further develop existing plants, within the framework of customer orders or the development of our own plants.\nIn our water chemistry lab, we test the efficiency of new high-performance chemicals in various fields of application. On behalf of our customers, we determine the optimum composition of water treatment chemicals for their treatment processes, then mix them according to recipe and supply the goods.\nNew Patent\nEnviroChemie Awarded Patent to Process for Extraction of Aluminium from Suds\nWorking within the scope of the research strategy \u201cReclamation and Recycling of Reusable Materials from Industrial Production Cycles and Wastewater\u201d, the EnviroChemie researchers have developed a process for the extraction of aluminium from suds. The primary objective of the research project was to find an economic process which could be used to extract aluminium in different concentrations from strongly alkaline suds and to enable re-use of the suds.\nThe addition of aluminium to the strongly alkaline suds reduces the service life of the suds and they become unusable over the course of time. The newly developed processed is based on converting the aluminium into a solid form (so-called zeolite precipitation) by adding soluble glass (alkali silicates) to the suds. The precipitates are separated from the suds by means of membrane filtration system with a cross-flow method. The recycling of the suds can function as a continuous process so that the operation of the operation bath does not have to be interrupted.\nAs Dr Engelhart, Head of Research and Development at EnviroChemie, reports, the process has already proved to be successful for the processing of suds used for cleaning bottles in the beverage industry.\n>> Patent Certificate\nNew plant solutions\nReduce operating costs for wastewater treatment by using Biomar Ecomizer technology\nBiogas, which consists mainly of methane and carbon dioxide, is generated during the anaerobic treatment of wastewater. A part of the carbon dioxide which is created dissolves into the wastewater in the anaerobic reactor, and the carbonic acid this creates leads to a fall in the pH value. As an alternative to using chemicals for the neutralisation required, EnviroChemie successfully installs its Biomar Ecomizer technology.\u00a0 The operating costs of the anaerobic system are significantly reduced. Payback periods of just a few years can be demonstrated for this process, due to the savings on caustic soda.\nWe have already installed Biomar Ecomizer technology in a number of wastewater treatment plants for Baltika, one of the largest brewery groups in Russia. Tests at a large wine making cooperative in Germany have shown that the installation of the technology can also be of benefit there.\nElectroflotation E-Flo-Dr. Baer expands the range of processes on offer\nWe have incorporated electroflotation technology into our range of plants, using the product name E-Flo-Dr. Baer. With over 40 years of experience in this specialised technology, Dr. Baer Verfahrenstechnik provides a mature process. The technology has been integrated into the system series of EnviroChemie products for water treatment, water recycling, and wastewater treatment, giving access to models that have proven themselves hundreds of times, in the field of measurement and control technology as well as pumps and drive technology.\nThis specialised electroflotation product complements the well-established Flomar\u00ae series of dissolved-air flotations. While investment costs are always higher compared to dissolved-air flotation, it can be used without any restrictions for water temperatures in excess of 80\u00b0 C, and barely creates any foam. The precise separation of the flotate ensures a high degree of cleansing, eliminating the need for further filter stages. This makes E-Flo-Dr. Baer electroflotation especially suitable for the cleaning and treatment of water circulation systems.\nEnviModul - flexible plant solutions for water and wastewater technology\nDecentralised water and wastewater technology is in demand worldwide.

In addition, we also supply pneumatic waste extraction systems for the graphics, paper and packaging industries and conveyor systems and sorting plants for municipal waste facilities.\nLP Series balers\nPresona is best known for its LP Series prepress balers. Versatile and with a range of custom-design features, LP Series balers are used by many blue chip organisations including Veolia, DS Smith, Smurfit Kappa, Asda, Tesco, COOP and XPO Logistics.\nOur innovative prepress technology creates consistent, high density bales which cuts transport costs. In addition, the prepress uses significantly less power than conventional balers, improving operational efficiency and reducing environmental impact.\nWe\u2019re happy to report that our clients have told us that the Presona prepress creates \u2018the best-looking bales with perfect stackability\u2019. We\u2019ll take that.\nFully automatic LP Series adaptive balers can be used to compact many different materials including: OCC, RDF, PET, newspapers, magazines, cardboard, print waste, municipal and solid waste. Models are available to suit low volume processors needing mill size bales up to integrated, high tonnage systems.\nUnlike shear balers, the prepress system does not need to cut off excess material. Instead it relies on an initial pre-compression step to achieve the best bales. This step delivers the improved bale consistency. It also gives a higher volume capacity per cycle. Added benefits include improved reliability, less wear and tear, reduced maintenance costs and minimised wire waste.\nEnergy efficiency is another important advantage. The prepress technology means that all of the baler\u2019s power is used for compaction, making LP Series balers up to 60% more energy efficient than comparable shear balers."}, {"title": "Vision", "description": "Our Vision\nTo be the world\u00b4s leading supplier of compaction equipment for recyclables in order to help our customers reduce, reuse, recycle and recover with focus on efficiency and to the best possible benefit of the professional operator.\nOur Mission\nTo supply the smartest compaction technology."}, {"title": "Our Business Concept", "description": "We develop, manufacture and market fully automatic balers and associated equipment for sorting, compacting and recycling a wide range of recyclable materials,\nWe supply complete waste extraction systems for handling of reject and waste in the printing, paper and packaging industry,\nWe provide full after-sales support for our products in the form of service and spare parts, to give our customer the possibility to handle waste in a cost efficient, safe and environmentally correct way."}, {"title": "Our Values", "description": "Passion and Pride\nProfessionality\nPeople\nPartnership"}, {"title": "Company Policy", "description": "We\u00a0must be known for\nWe accomplish this by"}, {"title": "Our Business Principles", "description": "At Presona, we work to create added value for our stakeholders without compromising the high standards we set in terms of our environmental and social responsibility.

Core values are what we stand for. Core values are a small set of timeless guiding principles taken to heart by the members and leadership of the organization. Core values require no external justification; they have intrinsic value and importance to those inside the organization. Note that a company may have operating practices and business strategies around certain qualities, without having them at the essence of their being. Companies that are successful have core values that remain fixed while their business strategies and practices may change to adapt to market conditions.\nVision provides guidance about what core to preserve and what future to stimulate progress toward.\nItasca is guided by the following strong core values.\nUncompromising attention to quality - We hold ourselves to the highest standards of quality in our products, services and professional interactions. We recognize that quality stems from attention to detail coupled with honesty, fairness and transparency. We thus provide comprehensive depictions of underlying procedures and algorithms in our software and reports. Our focus on quality results in the highest level of service and support to our clients.

In 1995, the present owner of the company became involved in the business.\nThat was the start of a complete turnaround in the company and the principle of continuous improvement was adopted. All products except for landfill compactors were given up, the organization and operations of the business were streamlined, new markets were entered into and customer experiences and feedback was gathered and carefully listened to in order to create even better landfill compactors. Product development was carried out in close cooperation with Norwegian customers, the distributor Magne Gitmark & Co. A/S, with whom we still co-operate with today.

Purchase from Voss today, you won't be disappointed.\nWhat We Do\nWell water (groundwater) is water that is used for public supply, individual household use, irrigation, aquaculture and agriculture and mining, among other smaller things. Roughly 37% of the water used for county and city water departments to supply households and businesses is groundwater. Groundwater provides drinking water to approximately 90% of the rural population and 42% for irrigation in the United States.\nGroundwater is exposed to a number of potential volatile organic compounds (VOC\u2019s). For example, a gas station, construction site or farm that uses chemicals can allow volatile organic compounds (VOC\u2019s) to seep into the ground and contaminate groundwater. Furthermore, sometimes wells are placed in sites that were once used to hold septic tanks or the like, and still house a number of different bacteria.\nVoss Technologies manufactures products that take samples of groundwater from wells to test them for volatile organic compounds (VOC\u2019s). There is a large variety of volatile organic compounds (VOC\u2019s) that are predominantly present in well water and can cause serious, even life threatening, illnesses and diseases. It is important to check your well water regularly, and in accordance with your state\u2019s regulations."}, {"title": "Our Guarantee:", "description": "Our No Hassle Guarantee\nIf you are not completely satisfied with any Voss Technologies product, simply return the unused portion for a full refund.\nOur Promise\nVoss Technologies is an industry leader in environmental sample supplies.

The HDPE used in Voss SingleSample products contains no plasticizers or additives.\nVoss Manufacturing\nVoss PTFE bailers are conventional and hand machined out of solid rod and block stock. Bailers are potentially exposed to volatile compounds and may require decontamination. Every Voss bailer is produced under entirely different conditions; the top piece, bottom valve and removal device are injection molded, with all tubing extruded. All of these processes take place off-site, away from the assembly facility.\nVoss Production\nOnce the parts are molded or extruded, they are packaged and shipped directly to our Voss Technologies assembly facility. Prior to assembly, all parts and tubing are immediately washed in Liquinox TM Detergent and rinsed individually with DI water. (This is a precautionary step, taken by Voss to remove any traces of compounds that may have found their way onto the tube through touch-transfer or other means in the manufacturing phase of production).\nFollowing the wash and rinse, all parts and tubing are air-dried in a controlled room and, after completely dried, are assembled and individually inserted into HDPE bags.

The reason why a shelter manufacturer company was interested in gas analysis was, that since 1959 in Finland, it has been compulsory to include a shelter in any building over a certain size. Naturally, the quality of air inside these shelters became a primary concern. This acquisition led to the creation of Temet Instruments Oy. At that stage, the company consisted of just four scientists.\nDuring it\u2019s early years the company was only focused on improving the\u00a0FTIR technology. All of a sudden, a demand for emissions monitoring equipment grew quickly as new environmental legislations were introduced and directives coming into effect. At this point the Gasmet story really begins.\nThe first Gasmet FTIR analyser was sold in 1993, and already in 1994, the sales were expanded to Europe and to the USA. In the early 2000s, demand for the company\u2019s products grew requiring high levels of investment that led to a management buyout. In 2006, the company\u00a0Gasmet Technologies Oy\u00a0was formed.\n1000 analyzers delivered2006\nSales and service\u00a0activities were undertaken by a global network of distributors and subsidiary offices in\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0(2005),\u00a0Canada\u00a0(2009), and in\u00a0Germany\u00a0(2013). All of the company\u2019s research, development, manufacturing and head office operations were brought into one facility in Helsinki.\nIn 2004, Gasmet launched\u00a0the world\u2019s first in-situ FTIR gas analyzer. Later, in 2008, Gasmet launched\u00a0the world\u2019s first portable ambient FTIR analyzer, the DX4030. Five years later, Gasmet introduced a new emission monitoring system for mercury measurements, the\u00a0Continuous Mercury Monitoring system\u00a0(CMM).\nIn 2015 Gasmet announced the acquisition of its\u00a0UK distributor\u00a0Quantitech Limited. This acquisition was designed to secure the long-term future of the business and to exploit the growth opportunities seen in the UK market.\nToday, we are proud to say that Gasmet has\u00a0delivered over 5000 FTIR analyzers worldwide.

Reliability, know-how, consulting competence, service, efficiency - these advantages ensure our market success to this day. Our goal is to redefine the quality of our products and application-specific expertise. Experience AERZEN and use our knowledge -\u00a0Expect Performance!\nAERZEN is an international manufacturer ofPositive Displacement Blowers,Hybrid Blowers,Screw CompressorsandTurbo Blowers. The high-quality machines are used for air and gas applications, for example in waste water treatment, pneumatic conveying of bulk materials and process gas conveying. In addition, AERZEN provides rental blowers quickly and easily.\nYears of experience, continuous technical developments and innovations combined with high internal quality standards have made the mechanical engineering company a world market leader for compressed air technologies. AERZEN stands forquality,engineering,first-class customer serviceandoutstanding product support.\nRight from the start, we work closely with our customers and deal with the industry-specific requirements of our technologies. We develop products and solutions according to realistic conditions, which not only satisfy the needs, but often exceed them. The variety of designs and serial customisation possibilities of our products are therefore almost unrivalled. This diversity, combined with the precise knowledge of the operational areas of our application specialists, enables us to develop plant concepts together with our customers that fully meet the requirements in terms of energy efficiency, longevity, reliability and expandability.\nAERZEN compressors have become indispensable in the American waste water industry. The machines are used especially for the ventilation of aeration tanks in wastewater treatment plants. This process step is the most energy-intensive of the entire waste water treatment process and holds a lot of potential for savings. That is why AERZEN has developed especially efficient and innovative concepts for its customers in the field of wastewater treatment. One of these, for example, is Performance\u00b3, in which\u00a0different compressor technologies are switched precisely along the load curve.\nThe compressed air requirement in wastewater treatment plants varies according to the time of day and the season: More compressed air is required during the day than at night. In summer the water demand of a place is generally higher than in winter. In order to avoid a waste of energy by a continuous use of all machines, the blowers are always used which can generate the currently required compressed air in the most energy-saving way. This ensures that only as much compressed air as necessary is generated in any given case. Overproduction and the associated waste of energy are avoided. The machines are switched on, off and on with the aid of intelligent machine controls, such as the AERsmart control system.\nAERZEN offers its customers a special service, the AERaudit, to improve the energy efficiency of existing plants. This makes it possible to check the energy saving potential of a system. In this way, technical improvements can be implemented in close cooperation with the customer, which usually pay for themselves very quickly.\nCustomers can also benefit from the expertise of the compressed air specialist in the field of pneumatic conveying. Pneumatic conveying of bulk materials or dusts is mainly required in the food, pharmaceutical or construction materials industries. Positive displacement blowers, screw compressors or turbo blowers generate a compressed air stream or negative pressure through which dusts or light goods such as flour are transported to the next production step. AERZEN guarantees\u00a0100% purity of the transported goods\u00a0due to its\u00a0absorbent and oil-free compressed air technology.\nIn addition to cleanliness, safety is a major factor in pneumatic conveying. Especially in petrochemical applications it is important to integrate explosion-proof processes. AERZEN has also developed appropriate solutions for this which, in addition to the known advantages, also have ATEX certification.\nThe possibilities of pneumatic conveying in industry are manifold:\nTurbo blowers or screw compressors, for example, ensure a reliable supply of flour in milling companies, generate the necessary negative pressure for the extraction systems for coal dust in lignite-fired power plants, or suck off the finest metal particles produced during the punching of sheet metal and return them to the production cycle.\nAERZEN solves even the most demanding individual application requirements.

Since 2000 Eldan has been a part of the environmental section of Carl Bennet AB - Lifco AB (website).\nIn 2001 Eldan moved to its current, larger facilities in Faaborg.\nIn 2005 Toni Reftman was made Managing Director of Eldan preparing the company for Steen Laursen\u2019s retirement.\nIn 2008 Eldan Recycling expanded their production facilities considerably by adding two new workshops to the premises and today the premises of Eldan Recycling A/S is covering an area of 10.000 m2.

OPSIS has provided thousands of systems both for ambient air quality monitoring\u00a0(AQM), for continuous emissions monitoring\u00a0(CEM), and for process control applications. The OPSIS systems are sold and serviced world-wide through a network of distributors and other representatives.  OPSIS\u2019 first focus area was gas detection in ambient air using a novel open-path technology called DOAS. It soon evolved to use the same technology also in industrial applications such as emissions monitoring in power plants and for process control in production facilities. Other types of gaseous and particulate detectors as well as other application-specific sensors were also added to the product portfolio, resulting in today\u2019s wide range of environmental monitoring equipment and related products and services.  Presently, OPSIS has about half of its business in the AQM field, and half of it in the CEM/process control field. The central monitoring equipment is almost always a DOAS analyser, operating either in the ultraviolet (UV) or the infrared (IR) wavelength region. The analyser is combined with other types of sensors and communication solutions, resulting in a complete environmental monitoring system.  A typical OPSIS system for AQM consists of a UV DOAS gas analyser, a beta attenuation dust monitor\u00a0and a set of meteorological sensors, monitoring local air quality. Multiple AQM systems are often combined in networks allowing full surveillance of the air in larger regions. The measurement results are usually forwarded to data management systems\u00a0over the Internet. This allows for real-time presentation of air quality as well as statistical analysis and air quality studies that can help improve the quality of the air we breathe.  A typical CEM/process control system consists of one or two DOAS analysers (UV\u00a0+ FTIR) for measurements of gas concentrations, in combination with other instruments providing e.g. flue gas flow rates and dust concentrations. The measurement results are often forwarded in real time to the process control system using any of the standard industrial communication protocols supported.

HOH applied for the first electrodeionization patents in 1981, which were issued in 1984, preceding the Millipore/Ionpure patents by two years. During the product development years of 1981-1989 a wide variety of EDI prototypes were designed and tested, including cylindrical EDI in a pressure vessel. With its new technology launched, the company went public in 1987.\nElectropure was born\nIn 1996, HOH changed its name to Electropure and began aggressively marketed the EPM\u2122 product line which became popular with a number of the \u201cearly adopters\u201d in the pure water industry. Electropure licensed its electrodeionization technology to Glegg Water in 1994, enabling Robert Glegg to develop E-Cell\u00ae, now Suez Water\u2019s EDI technology.\nContinued innovation\nIn 1998 Electropure finished development and patented its Excellion\u2122 ion exchange membranes and process, which enabled the XL\u2122 product line to be developed in 1999.\nThe next step\n2004 marked the introduction of the Electropure XL-HTS\u2122 (High Temperature Stable) electrodeionization product line. SnowPure\u2019s product line expanded again in 2005 with the introduction of Zapwater\u2122 EDI for laboratories. SnowPure, a private corporation, was formed in 2005 and via a management buyout acquired Electropure\u2019s EDI division. In 2006, SnowPure embarked on an aggressive expansion in China, opening up its sales office in Shanghai.\nCelebrating our past, building our future\nIn 2007, SnowPure launched the XL-R industrial EDI product line. SnowPure International was formed in Hong Kong in 2008. The next year was highlighted by the addition of a revolutionary low-energy, compact UV product to the SnowPure line. In 2011, SnowPure launched the EXL\u2122\u00a0EDI series worldwide and opened a global production and logistics facility in China.\nWe are actively working to add technologies that make electrodeionization work better, for example for hemodialysis water, and reducing silica further for semiconductor and power generation.

Sustainable technologies, such as ScaleBuster, are seeing increased investment from Global, European and North American Companies as business culture adapts. The technology developed in the United Kingdom has had more than US$8.5m (\u00a36m) invested for its launch into North American cooling system applications marketed under the brand EnviroTower TM.We seek global business partners, OEM supply, Distributors, Licensees and marketing organisations to penetrate various worldwide markets with our patented ScaleBuster technology.About the technologyThe patented ScaleBuster technology can completely replace traditional chemical treatment of certain cooling systems; providing control of scale and corrosion in various water process systems to create an exceptionally clean system. This dramatically reduces energy and water consumption, while reducing or, in certain cases, eliminating toxic water discharge to the environment.How does it work?Once the ISB is installed into the system the calcium and magnesium are precipitated into suspension. These particles remain within the flow of the water. When these particles reach the hot parts of the system the tendency to adhere to the hot surfaces is dramatically reduced. Therefore the ScaleBuster protects the equipment from potential limestone damage. The ISB is conceived to make the particles formed non-adherent. After installation of the ISB, limestone is mainly present in the form of aragonite, which is a non-adherent crystalline structure contrary to the untreated calcite that can cause deterioration and damage in unprotected systems."}, {"title": "About ION Enterprises", "description": "A Pioneer in Green Corrosion & Scale Inhibiting Technology\nFounded in 1990 in England, ION Enterprises manufacturers a range of environmental water treatment devices under the trademark ION ScaleBuster\u00ae.

The patented, electrostatic device operates without electrical power and has no moving components. The electrostatic device uses the dielectric characteristics of the special plastics and metallic materials of its construction combined with the hydraulic conditions present during operation to force the precipitation of solid crystals in the water. This reduces the likelihood of scale and corrosion from forming and conditions the water to absorb scale already attached to internal equipment surfaces.The range of applications to which ScaleBuster can be used is extensive. Experience since 1994 with this technology shows that the fundamental requirements vary depending on water systems, system layout and equipment to be protected. The requirements will also vary depending on whether the product is for new construction or refurbishment of an existing system. newterra has established a family of products to cover the range of installations from individual appliance protection and building usage through to large heavy industrial process applications.\nCustomer Benefits\n"}, {"title": "key words", "description": "water physical sacrificial Zinc anode galvanic electro static electrostatic conditioning conditioner treater treatment corrosion scale build up scaling prevention corrosion-free scle-free ScaleBuster ScaleBuster ScaleBuster ISB scalemaster scaleblaster scalebaster scalebster"}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/lakes-environmental-software-3824", "id": "3824", "name": "Lakes Environmental Software", "description": "Lakes Environmental is committed to supplying robust and easy-to-use air dispersion modeling software to consulting companies, industries, governmental agencies and academia.

It is providing our employees with learning opportunities to meet their development needs.

Because when we have achieved the level we want to reach, then we want to become better.

We believe strongly that \u201cThere is always a better way\u201d; a way to improve what at first may look like the perfect way.

Volatile Organic Compounds include industrial chemicals, solvents, alcohols, and also petroleum products such as\u00a0 gasoline. VOC's combine with sunlight to form atmospheric ozone, or smog."}, {"title": "What is Zeolite?", "description": "Zeolite is a naturally occurring mineral, in crystal form. Natural zeolite is made of hydrous aluminium silicates of sodium, calcium, potassium or barium ions.\nNatural zeolite is hydrophilic (water loving) and readily adsorbs and desorbs water. More recently, synthetic zeolites have been developed for commercial applications. Over 70 types of synthetic zeolites have been created. Hydrophobic zeolite is an inorganic, stable crystal with properties suited to adsorbing VOC\u2019s. The zeolite's inert properties mean that it does not promote chemical reactions and will not even react with strong acids. It is also non-flammable to extreme temperatures."}, {"title": "How Do Zeolites Work?", "description": "The basic molecular structure of a zeolite is a tetrahedron or pyramid, formed by silicon oxides (SiOn). The tetrahedron has one silicon atom in the center and oxygen at each of the corners. The tetrahedral zeolites are linked together by oxygen atoms. Linked zeolites form pores, the size of which are determined by how many zeolite molecules are linked together.\nDepending of the number of linkages and which alkali ions are present in the crystal structure, several types of zeolites are formed, all with different pore sizes. The size of the pores also determines which VOC\u2019s can be adsorbed.\nMunters Zeol uses a mixture of hydrophobic zeolites with different pore sizes. This mixture allows a wide range of organic solvents to be adsorbed. In fact, most commercially available solvents are adsorbed by these hydrophobic zeolites.\nA VOC is attracted and held in the zeolite pore by a weak attractive force. This weak physical attractive force between chemically neutral compounds is known as the van der Waals force. The VOC will remain in the pore until it heated, at which time the VOC will be released from the zeolite into the air.\nWhen VOC laden air flows past zeolite molecules, the zeolite acts as a reverse filter or molecular sieve, capturing the compounds which are able to adsorb and allowing the compounds that are too large to flow past."}, {"title": "Zeolite and the HoneyCombe Rotor", "description": "Munters Zeol combined the hydrophobic zeolite technology with its HoneyCombe rotor technology. A system was created that can operate continuously with constant adsorption and desorption, has a low pressure drop, and maximized the surface area. One square foot of HoneyCombe media has a surface area of 492,480 ft2 ( 45,753 m2).HoneyCombe rotors were developed over 40 years ago by Munters. Munters is the world\u2019s leading supplier of process systems using HoneyCombe rotors for dehumidification, heat exchange, and VOC abatement. Munters\u2019 HoneyCombe rotors have numerous benefits. Rotors allow for high air flow, truly continuous operation. With a low pressure drop rotors have stable outlet conditions. The hydrophobic zeolite is permanently bonded with the HoneyCombe rotor therefore no attrition of the zeolite occurs. Munters HoneyCombe rotors are manufactured at the ISO 9001 certified facility in Amesbury, Massachusetts. The rotors are manufactured from a corrugated mineral fiber substrate permanently bonded with a proprietary mixture of hydrophobic zeolite and inorganic materials. The hydrophobic zeolite rotor is inorganic, completely inert and has rigidity, physical integrity and the ability to withstand thermal stress. The permanently bonded hydrophobic zeolite is an integral part of the HoneyCombe matrix and will not be leached out or removed physically or chemically."}, {"title": "How a Munters Zeol Rotor Concentrator Works", "description": "As a low concentration VOC laden air stream enters the hydrophobic Zeolite HoneyCombe rotor the air passes through the HoneyCombe media. The rotor turns several revolutions per hour continuously transporting VOC laden zeolite back into the regeneration sector and regenerated zeolite into the process section. In the process section the VOCs are adsorbed onto the zeolite and the clean air is exhausted to the atmosphere.In an isolated section, a small, hot stream of clean air is drawn through the rotor. This stream is normally only 5\u201310% of the process volume. The hot air desorbs the VOCs from the zeolite forming a concentrated VOC laden air stream. The regenerated zeolite is returned to the process.The concentrated stream is sent to a small oxidizer. The oxidizer converts the VOCs to carbon dioxide and water vapor which are exhausted to the atmosphere. The energy content of the VOCs contributes to the oxidation process further reducing the fuel requirement.The concentrated VOC stream can also be sent to alternate technologies, such as a condenser which recovers the VOCs for potential reuse, or a biofilter."}, {"title": "Overview:", "description": "Munters is a global leader in energy efficient and sustainable air treatment and climate solutions.

The desire to understand and satisfy the needs of existing and potential customers is only possible because of the nature of the KREBS\u00ae team.Most of our products and continuous improvements made were initiated from field experience. We actively review the performance in operation and make necessary modifications to ensure that our products have the lowest owning and operating costs in the industry.\u00a0KREBS\u00ae Slurry Pumps\nThe original millMAX pump revolutionised the slurry pump industry with the initial patented suction side anti-recirculation device. This feature gained rapid acceptance in the mining industry, enabling FLSmidth to expand the range of KREBS pumps to what it is today.The range now encompasses metal, rubber and urethane-lined pumps, including high head, high efficiency, high pressure, vertical cantilever and recessed impeller options.The nature of slurry pumping requires excellent availability of spare parts. To provide the support our customers need and expect, we manufacture in several locations and have warehousing in many countries and regions. The right part at the right time and at the right location is essential to our customers, and therefore, to us.KREBS\u00ae Cyclones\nSince 1952, our advanced hydrocyclone technology has evolved to the latest generation KREBS\u00ae gMAX cyclone with patented geometry enhancements, providing high throughput and industry-leading performance. The finer and sharper separations resulting from these improvements benefit processes from hard rock mining, coal, pulp & paper, chemicals, power (FGD), and much more.As we constantly expand usage of advanced engineered wear materials, we continually extend the life of our cyclones, thus reducing maintenance requirements and lowering total cost of ownership. Combined with unique condition monitoring solutions, the performance of downstream processes is also enhanced, reducing unscheduled downtime and increasing plant production.KREBS\u00ae Slurry Valves\nCustomers from around the world are familiar with our long history of manufacturing quality equipment and the KREBS\u00ae Technequip Valves are no exception to the rule.Our KREBS\u00ae Technequip valves are designed as a premium heavy-duty slurry valve that can measure up to the most demanding applications.

Brothers Dick and Kelly Krebs manufactured and sold their first cyclone in 1953 to an aggregate company in Orange, California. Over the next 12 years, the Krebs brothers took a revolutionary approach to the calculation, design, and production of cyclones, laying the foundation for the success of KREBS\u00ae cyclones.By 1965, the company has become renowned for its products, not just in United States, but in other countries, as well. The cyclone models were sold to industrial, water treatment, mining and other industries.Today, KREBS pumps, cyclones and valves are sold in almost every country on the globe. We stand by our products and we continue to design and innovate the cyclones that the Krebs boys started almost 70 years ago."}, {"title": "History", "description": "Richard Krebs and Kelly Krebs founded Krebs Engineers in 1952 and today FLSmidth Krebs is the world\u2019s leading supplier of hydrocyclones, with offices in eight countries. Read how it all began.\nRichard Krebs and Kelly Krebs founded Krebs Engineers\nIn 1950, Bob Clarkson and Kelly Krebs created a partnership called 'The Clarkson Company', for the sole purpose of manufacturing and selling Bob\u2019s reagent feeder. In December of 1950, they purchased the rights to a cyclone like device called the Centriclone from an inventor named Norris Goodwin.The Company was incorporated as Equipment Engineers in 1952, Dick Krebs, Kelly\u2019s brother, was brought into the company later that year. In 1953, Equipment Engineers sold the rights to the Centriclone to Oliver Filters, a company that was later merged into The Dorr Company to become Dorr-Oliver. With the money from the sale of the Centriclone, the Company was able to develop the concept of the first heavy-duty mining cyclone, which had cast metal housings and replaceablemolded gum rubber liners.Equipment Engineers sold its first commercial cyclone in 1953. It was a Model EE10-4 Cyclone sold to Sandy Muller Aggregate in Orange, California with serial no. 1000 (I guess they didn\u2019t want Sandy Muller to feel like they were buying the first cyclone). In 1959, Kelly and Bob decided to split the Company into two separate companies.Bob Clarkson took the valve and reagent feeder products and incorporated as The Clarkson Company.\nKrebs Products in the Early Days\nRichard and Kelly kept the cyclone line and the Company grew into what we know it as today, the world\u2019s leading supplier of hydrocyclones, with offices in eight countries.The Company changed its name from Equipment Engineers to Krebs Engineers in 1965 in honor of Dick and Kelly Krebs. Kelly died in 1959, and Dick died in 1962.

As the first global environmental union, it brought together governments and civil society organisations with a shared goal to protect nature. Its aim was to encourage international cooperation and provide scientific knowledge and tools to guide conservation action.\nDuring the first decade of its existence, IUCN\u2019s primary focus was to examine the impact of human activities on nature. It flagged the damaging effects of pesticides on biodiversity, and promoted the use of environmental impact assessments, which have since become the norm across sectors and industries.\nMuch of IUCN\u2019s subsequent work in the 1960s and 1970s was devoted to the protection of species and the habitats necessary for their survival. In 1964, IUCN established the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, which has since evolved into the world\u2019s most comprehensive data source on the global extinction risk of species.\nIUCN also played a fundamental role in the creation of key international conventions, including the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (1971), the World Heritage Convention (1972), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, (1974) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992).\nIn 1980, IUCN \u2013 in partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) \u2013 published the\u00a0World Conservation Strategy, a ground-breaking document which helped define the concept of \u2018sustainable development\u2019 and shaped the global conservation and sustainable development agenda.\nA subsequent version of the strategy,\u00a0Caring for the Earth,\u00a0was published by the three organisations in the run-up to the 1992 Earth Summit. It served as the basis for international environmental policy and guided the creation of the Rio Conventions on biodiversity (CBD), climate change (UNFCCC) and desertification (UNCCD).\nIn 1999, as environmental issues continued to gain importance at the international stage, IUCN was granted official observer status to the United Nations. Today it remains the only environmental organisation with such status.\nIn the early 2000s, IUCN developed its business engagement strategy. Prioritising sectors with a significant impact on nature and livelihoods, such as mining and oil and gas, its aim is to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable.\nLater in the 2000s, IUCN pioneered \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 \u2013 actions to conserve nature which also address global challenges, such as food and water security, climate change and poverty reduction.\nToday, with the expertise and reach of its more than 1,300 Members \u2013 including States, government agencies, NGOs and Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Organisations \u2013 and over 10,000 international experts, IUCN is the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network.

Since then, the modular and compact TIA system technology that has proven itself of value in practice with industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants, has been developed.In the founding year, Phoenix AG, an automotive-supplier based in Hamburg, placed the first order with TIA. Many more orders by diverse German industrial enterprises followed during the adjacent years until today.In 1997 TIA constructed the first wastewater treatment plant abroad: the customer was a Dutch recycling-company. Ever since, TIA has successfully planned and constructed wastewater treatment plants not only in Germany, but internationally.The first non-European international order was placed by a Malaysian electronic industry in 1998.TIA has also gained a lot of experience in the municipal sector: Since 1987, TIA has been carrying out service and maintenance for municipal wastewater treatment plants. For example, in 2003 TIA closed a contract for the operation of the municipal wastewater treatment plant of G\u00fcster (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany)and has been solely responsible for it ever since.The biggest project carried out by TIA so far was the planning and construction of a central wastewater treatment plant for all industrial wastewaters of the country of Kuwait: 7,500m\u00b3/day of wastewater from different kinds of industries are brought to the plant every day by approximately 300 road tankers.

A weighbridge, by nature, is very unlikely to be the tallest structure in its locality and so will rarely be directly struck by lightning. If it does receive a direct hit then no weighbridge in the world could withstand the electrical energy that would strike it and then pass through its load cells as the easiest route to earth.\nShering approach the problem of lightning protection from the point of view of preventing damage from this dissipated energy. We do this by using a PATENTED loadcell assembly unit which fits an insulating component between the ground and the weighbridge deck. The dielectric properties of this insulator are such that it will restrict the voltage potential across the weighbridge and its load cells to less than 100V, which is the level the load cells can comfortably withstand without damage.\n>Over 10 years of use on Shering weighbridges around the World has proved this insulator to be both electrically durable and structurally strong enough in the most arduous conditions.\n\nThank you for giving Eagle Weighing Systems Ltd \u00a0the privilege to serve you\nFor any further inquiries, mail or contact us\nAddress: Wandegeya University Plaza Room A18\nFor orders and deliveries please contact us on :\u00a0+256 (0) 700225423\n+256 (0) 787089315\nOr email us at;eagleweighingsystems@gmail.com"}, {"title": "Weighbridge shop in Uganda", "description": "Weighbridge The\u00a0C85 HSDS\u00a0is a high-resistance low-profile\u00a0above-ground\u00a0weighbridge, fitted with a single-block concrete platform, that is\u00a0designed to meet several or non-standard application requirements.\u00a0It is highly robust and adapts to major dimensions.\u00a0With a low-profile slab, its height remains low, which limits access\u00a0ramp lengths.

Our weighbridge platforms (made of steel) are designed very carefully to withstand these loads without damage and is highly durable. The girders and plates used in our platform are selected very carefully and undergo stringent quality checks as per UNBS Grade.\nThe next most important component is the mounting assembly for load cells. This transfers the load from the platform to the load cells. This is a cradle assembly which is free to move in the horizontal axes and hence takes all side loads generated due to the vehicular movements on the platform. The mounting assembly consists of three parts namely, the Bottom Plate, Rocker assembly and Top Bracket.\nThe signal from the load cells (in milli-volt) is carried to the digitizer, in the control room, through a 4 - core shielded cable. The cable has a very low electrical resistance and hence, no loss of signals. The cables from different load cells, in a weighbridge, meets in weather proof junction box. The junction Box is of fully molded type and houses the necessary terminal blocks for interconnection of load cell out puts.

Its life is 100 years as compared to that of 15 years of a typical steel platform. Due to the advantages of concrete platforms, the developed world has been using them for over 30 years. In Europe 95% of electronic weigh bridges are made with concrete platform.\nAs the platform gets longer, cost saving increases. Modern day transportation is moving towards using longer trucks and trailers.The concrete platform weighbridge can bear heavier loads. That is why all modern bridges that one sees on the city roads are either concrete or composite.\nA heavily loaded truck entering the weigh bridge gives heavy jerks on braking.

With this cooling system, the biogas produced in the fermenter at a temperature of around 40\u00b0C is cooled down using ambient air alone. This process reduces the costs compared to conventional cooling units by up to 75 percent, because for just under half the year the outside temperature is colder than 11\u00b0C at our latitude and, in 91 percent of the hours in the year, it is less than 20\u00b0C. It is precisely this temperature pattern that makes the economy cooling system so successful.\nThe company was founded in 1998 and today, at our production plant in Essen, we manufacture products for increasing the efficiency of gas engines in biogas plants and other applications, with a high degree of vertical integration. More than 50 people \u2013 from engineers to trainees \u2013 work for SILOXA . All plant components are individually designed, manufactured and, if desired, installed. This means that our customers receive everything from a single source. Naturally, this also includes a comprehensive after-sales service, providing optimal support and maintenance of the gas conditioning plants.\nFor all our gas conditioning plants, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the product itself and of the expected maintenance work together with detailed data sheets. We design the plants to suit the conditions on site and your specific requirements, so we have prepared a request form for each product."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/berg-chilling-systems-inc-77404", "id": "77404", "name": "BERG Chilling Systems Inc.", "description": "Berg Chilling Systems designs, manufactures, installs and services industrial thermal process control systems for a broad range of industries and specialized applications around the world.

The enterprise\u2019s ability to repair even the most extensively damaged or worn machinery soon attracted work from further afield.\nWhen the business expanded in 1958, Irvine Bell built a new workshop on his smallholding. Now joined by his brother Robert, brother-in-law Malcolm Campbell and with Eunice keeping the books, the small enterprise, I A Bell and Company, provided a general engineering service along with limited manufacturing of Irvine\u2019s various inventions.\nAmong them a self-loading sugar cane trailer and an overhead transfer crane for local farmers.\nWith the family home built alongside the workshops, sons Peter, Gary and Paul grew up amongst the welding sparks and machine shop swarf in a grease filled mechanical parts intensive environment.\nIn the early 1960\u2032s Irvine Bell saw a further opportunity to improve the sugar cane harvesting process. While a few rudimentary cane loading machines had appeared on the scene, most were adapted farm tractors and as such lacked manoeuvrability to quickly gather a load of cane.\nIrvine Bell\u2019s approach was to develop a whole new class of machine. Utilising emerging hydrostatic technology and borrowing hydraulic motors from an old motor grader, his prototype three wheeled loader was granted a patent and named the greatly manoeuvrable self propelled machine.\nAble to control each of the large drive wheels independently, the Bell Tri-Wheeler could turn instantly on its own axis. Also the simple control concept, was easily assimilated by operators without any previous machinery experience.\nChoosing to focus on the general engineering side of his business, Irvine Bell licensed the manufacture of his Cane Loader to a Johannesburg based locomotive company that was active in cane transport at the time.\nThe quest to design productive mobile machinery was not lost on his sons. Peter and Gary\u2019s first go-kart, scrounged together during school holidays, could pull a small tip trailer. And with a dozer blade fitted to the front of the cart to spread gravel, the rig was put to work repairing the dirt roads on the smallholding!\nBy the early 1970\u2032s the business had again expanded to a new facility in Empangeni\u2019s industrial area.\nWith the construction of a greenfields port in nearby Richards Bay, the Company provided many innovative engineering solutions to the port\u2019s contracting consortium. Among them light-weight, high flotation earthmoving dumper trailers that could cope with the soft sand conditions.\nNow with the next generation on board in the business, Irvine Bell, together with sons Peter and Gary developed and patented a cane cutting attachment that enabled the Tri-Wheeler to further mechanise cane harvesting.\nIrvine Bell was nevertheless wary of his son\u2019s ambition to venture into mass production, warning the boys that within a year they could lose interest after producing the same piece of machinery on a continuous basis.\nInstead, after a windfall maiden production year which saw fifty units produced, the Company was rising to the challenge of successful manufacturing. Applying practical hydrostatic systems experience gained while working on sabbatical with the Vickers distributor, Peter Bell made significant improvements to the Tri-Wheeler\u2019s design and in 1975, with the expiry of the manufacturing licence which had seen production being outsourced, Bell itself began production of complete machines.\nThe number of applications where the Tri-Wheeler could be used grew. Fitted with a forklift mast, the Rough Terrain Forklift version was quickly embraced by the country\u2019s brick industry. For the expanding timber industry, a log handling version was configured. Equipped with a log grab, the Bell Logger proved to be the ideal tool to gather logs and to load transporters.\nObserving the deficiencies in the adapted farm tractors used as transporters in the sugar and timber industries, Peter Bell conceptualised a more robust machine. Purpose built for haul work with a truck-style drivetrain, a steel chassis and tough earthmoving machine for construction, the Bell Rigid Tractor, together with a range of job matched trailers, found a ready market in cane and timber haulage which then expanded into earthmoving applications.\nNow working in the earthmoving industry, Peter Bell saw the opportunity to apply the hauler\u2019s strong simple design philosophy to the Front End Loader concept. He set about designing a tough \u2018Built-for-Africa\u2019 mid-size Wheeled Loader range that were destined to become market leaders in their class. After a few years of marketing their growing product range through independent distributors, the Company recognised the advantage of having its own dedicated outlets to provide customers with factory direct support. And so the Bell Customer Service Centre support network was born. Beginning with a branch in Johannesburg, Bell Equipment soon had national coverage and within a few years exports to neighbouring countries put Bell firmly on the map.\nBy the early 1980\u2032s with a factory staff of just over 100, the manufacturing operation had outgrown the Empangeni facility and in 1984 a new custom built factory located in Richards Bay was commissioned. By this time the Tri-Wheel Loader range had found ready markets abroad and the plant provided product in kit form to final assembly facilities in Mauritius which in turn supplied Cane Loaders locally and into Africa. A New Zealand assembly facility provided loaders for the Australasian forest industry. In the United States, the Company first partnered with a large forestry equipment manufacturer to build American versions of the Logger. Later Bell Equipment established its own facilities in the southern timber market to distribute products exported from the Richards Bay plant.\nAlso during the early 1980\u2032s a new configuration of earthmover arrived in the South African market place. These Articulated Dump Trucks imported from Europe were effective and versatile. Bell nevertheless saw room for improvement, fine tuning their design to better cope with the harsh operating conditions common in Africa.\nLaunched in 1985, Bell Equipment\u2019s first Articulated Dump Truck, the 25 ton model was a resounding success. This led to new models expanding the range. Lighter, faster models extended the artic truck application to a greater number of challenging hauls. By 1989, with the doubling of the Richards Bay plant capacity, the flagship 40 ton capacity Articulated Dump Truck was launched and our worldwide team of employees had grown to 1 650.\nToday the Bell Articulated Dump Truck range has again expanded, breaking new ground with the mining-focused 50 ton capacity B50D. To compliment its own product range, Bell Equipment has partnered with global equipment manufacturers to provide customers with a comprehensive range of machines in the construction, forestry, mining and agriculture industries. The group has a customer devoted distribution network that is proud of their service record.\nOur strategic partnership formed with one of the world\u2019s largest equipment manufacturers, the John Deere Company, during 1999 provides the financial strength to realise our goal \u2013 be the world\u2019s premium Articulated Dump Truck supplier, and in Africa the equipment brand of choice.\nBy partnering with customers and suppliers we have been able to grow from humble beginnings, where Irvine Bell from his tiny engineering works inspired the search for a better way."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/dexcom-solutions-ltd-24089", "id": "24089", "name": "Dexcom Solutions Ltd.", "description": "Dexcom Solutions Ltd. is an environmental, technology and engineering company.Nigeria offering a wide range of services and solutions primarily to the environmental and oil industries.

Some 60 persons are employed in the company.\nFACILITIES The company is highly integrated and includes the following departments most of which occupy their own individual sites:\nPRODUCTION RANGE The compounding, extrusion moulding, injection moulding and machining of Vesconite and Vesconite Hilube make up most of the production.\nA wide range of standard ready-to-use bushes is also made, while a great variety of custom made finished components are machined from stock and moulded shapes.\nVesconite Hilube was introduced in the late 1980's. It is a further enhancement of the self lubricating properties of Vesconite. Vesconite Hilube is an extra low wear and low friction premium grade.\nVescoPolycap, Vescolene PE and Vescolene PP are produced as extruded rods, as well as moulded and machined.\nOther high performance bearing materials such as Hilube 10, Hilube 20 and Vescoflex are also compounded and moulded for special applications\nAPPLICATIONS VescoPlastics specialises in polymeric materials for bearing applications produced in heavy sections. These materials are designed for many applications where relatively high loads are carried at relatively low speeds, with little or no lubrication, in often dirty or immersed conditions. Custom components include small and large bushes, wear pads and strips, and many parts subject to friction and wear, in many industries including railways, shipping, heavy transport, earth moving, mining, and manufacturing.\nIn summary, VescoPlastics' special formulations and custom components find application in any industry with moving parts where there is a desire for longer life wear parts with the added benefits of less greasing and less maintenance.\nFOREIGN ASSOCIATIONS VescoPlastics has exported its products for over 25 years and the Vesconite trademark has been registered in most parts of the industrialised world, including the United States.\nIt has been the company's policy to expand abroad mainly through independent, well trained distributors fully dedicated to Vesconite. These include:\nThe company also has distributors in Argentina, France, Finland, Greece, Namibia, New Zealand, Zambia and Zimbabwe\nDISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING POLICY The specialised nature of the product range requires that it should be sold on the basis of its cost effectiveness in particular applications. Thus a well informed technical approach, related to the needs of a particular client or market, is generally required for success. This is a general requirement for selling high performance materials. The management devotes much of its time to the study and proposed solutions of such needs.\nThe education of the market and the solution of technical problems in as cost effective a manner as possible have been basic to the growth and success of the company. Coupled with this is an emphasis on client service and fulfilling promised deliveries.\nPROMOTION Promotion by means of the Internet and direct mail aims to inform the engineering and designer community and to encourage enquiries. Such enquiries are carefully studied, recommendations made and prototype trials initiated when the application and the economics appear promising. Use is also made of advertising and editorial engineering publications with a high readership of design engineers.\nMATERIAL ADVANTAGES Vesconite and Vesconite Hilube can claim after over 30 years of extensive usage to offer one of the best all round non-metallic bush and bearing materials, readily available, made of the only modified polymers of their kind, which combine low friction, low wear, self lubrication, good dimensional stability, very low water absorption, suitability for both dry and immersed applications, good load carrying ability, easy machinability - all at greater cost effectiveness than traditional bearing metals.\nPRODUCTION ADVANTAGES VescoPlastics is possibly the only company in the production of engineering plastic materials and finished components which also formulates, develops, compounds and produces its own raw materials.\nThis results in an intimate knowledge of its products and their capabilities and an ability of offer more cost effective solutions. Where an application is of sufficient scope, and requires a bearing material with special characteristics, VescoPlastics will consider the development of a custom formulation.\nCOMPANY ADVANTAGES VescoPlastics' main focus on engineering plastic applications as related to friction and wear problems gives it a great deal of effectiveness in solving existing problems and developing new applications.\nIts technical approach is less concerned with possible short term returns than with the need to satisfy the long term needs of its clients through a cost effective answer to their problems - by providing components and materials that last longer, with little or no greasing."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/samsi-pe-ta-sa-mechanical-seals-pe-85718", "id": "85718", "name": "SAMSI PE ta SA Mechanical Seals PE ", "description": "We stock import and export mechanical seals \r\nfor all pumping industries.\r\nDistribute to over 30 countries and locals service and technical support.\r\nWeb Store , for ease of ordering.\r\nUnbeatable stock and Prices\r\nMechanical Seal Refurbishment, Repair Facilty to replace or repair all makes of Mechanical seals.\r\n", "address": "    South Africa", "details": {"Business Type": "Distributor", "Industry Type": "Commercial", "Market Focus": "Globally (various continents)", "Year Founded": "2001", "Employees": "1-10", "Turnover": "less than $1,000,000 US"}, "panels": []}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/procon-environmental-technologies-pty-ltd-37781", "id": "37781", "name": "Procon Environmental Technologies (Pty) Ltd.", "description": "Procon Environmetal Technologies (Pty) Ltd. offer a full scope of Environmental Products & Technologies, specializing in systems that minimize the impact of contamination on the environment and surrounding areas.

Potter held exclusive patents on the design of the turbine flowmeter. Potter Aeronautical began licensing the turbine flowmeter to other companies, both domestic and internationally. At the time Potter Aeronautical closed in 1968, its\u2019 production manager was young engineer named Ken Hoffer. Ken then founded his own turbine flowmeter company\u2026Hoffer Flow Controls.   For the first ten years in business Hoffer Flow Controls specialized in cryogenic flow measurement systems. Hoffer pioneered the use of the turbine flowmeter in cryogenics.  During the late 1970's we began to diversify into other markets, including oil patch, chemical and petrochemical, aerospace and energy measurement. More recently, we have introduced our products to the European Common Market, Central and South America and the Far East, and have expanded our product line to include magnetic and ultrasonic style flowmeters.  A key feature in our high precision turbine flowmeter that differentiates them from other turbine flowmeters is the hybrid ceramic ball bearings. Designed to tolerate gas spinning during cool-down in any cryogenic fluid application, this type of bearing will far outlast all other types of open race bearings in any clean liquid or gas application. Open race ball bearings, as used by other manufacturers depend on the flowing fluid for lubricity therefore, open race bearings can fail quickly.

Water as a limited resource can meet the needs of the society and nature by means of water reuse and the implementation of modern technologies.\nGaining access to water for domestic use \u2013 both drinking (potable) water and water for sanitation and washing \u2013 remains a challenge for many Namibians, especially those in rural communities. Having to source water from remote supplies each day creates a situation whereby time and energy are devoted to meeting a basic human need; where family members must spend many hours a day in just fetching water for use in the home this can have impacts on school attendance and the ability of women, in particular, to engage in income-generating activities. Where such supplies are of dubious quality or are unsustainable, the issues only multiply.\nFurthermore, those businesses/industries and institutions such as schools and healthcare facilities located outside water articulation networks struggle to operate effectively if they do not have a guaranteed drinking water supply or a safe way to dispose of their wastewater.\nThe Harambee Prosperity Plan sets out a number of large-scale activities designed to bring safe drinking water to 100 per cent the Namibian people by 2020 while at the same time monitoring the effectiveness of water management measures and enhancing water security. But as the recent drought years have shown us, there also needs to be a change in mind-set so that domestic and industrial water use becomes wise, rather than wasteful, and reflects the scarcity of this resource in an arid country such as ours.\nThe development of new technologies has seen the introduction of high-quality wastewater treatment and sanitation products into the Namibian market over the past few years.

Mitigation describes the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimise the changes ahead.

The elimination of odor and sludge in manure storage pits and lagoons along with the reduction of corrosive gases in animal confinement buildings through the use of VBT became a major contributor to the development of environmentally sound agriculture.By the 1990s, Vacuum Bubble Technology had been adapted to improve the operation of home septic tanks. Addition of the Vacuum Bubble Technology Aerator to an existing or new home septic tank showed that a clear, odorless effluent was produced, and there was a reduction in the need for regular sludge pumping. It was also found that the use of VBT extended the life of drain fields. A further refinement of the Vacuum Bubble Technology Aerator was the development of a retrofit kit for installation in failed aerobic treatment units.All kitchen waste from restaurants is held in underground grease traps and the VBT was shown to reduce costs through the less frequent need for grease trap pumping. Customers and restaurant staff were also pleased by the elimination of offensive grease trap odors. Cleaner grease trap effluent also meant less clogging and fewer backups in kitchen drains.The same principles that made Vacuum Bubble Technology so effective in livestock production were also found to be applicable to large commercial users in many industrial applications. Industrial processes which had foul odors due to an accumulation of anaerobic bacteria were improved by the Vacuum Bubble Technology Aerator. Operating costs relating to disposal of unintended organic sludge accumulation were significantly reduced or, as in some cases, eliminated.In 2001, with the colaboration of Advanced Aeration International\u00a0 (AAI) and the Space Alliance Technology Outreach Program (SATOP) the technology was further developed in the aquaculture environment. The use of VBT\u2122 demonstrated increased survival rates and increased yields of fish in breeding ponds.\n"}, {"title": "Markets", "description": "The measure of its success lies in the ever-growing network of Licensed\u00a0Technology Providers (LTP) in these markets.

A goal of aeration common to all Markets is the elimination of odors. VBT achieves this, and additional goals, by supporting aerobic bacterial metabolism as opposed to the more common, and inefficient, odor producing anaerobic consumption of organic waste.\nBelow is a table showing the markets within which AA is currently operating through the LTP network.

In this regard, the city\u2019s official waste management service provider, Pikitup Johannesburg (Pty) Ltd, has a crucial role to play. Founded in January 2001 with the City of Johannesburg as its sole shareholder, Pikitup took its place in a society recovering from the mistakes of the past but energised by hope for the future. It was an era of comprehensive change at all levels of national and local government, and not least in the waste management sector. Traditionally, South Africa had followed an \u2018end of pipe\u2019 waste management philosophy that resulted in a small percentage of waste being recycled, with the remaining bulk of the waste stream being disposed of at landfill sites. With urban real estate at a premium, and our natural resource base under growing pressure, a new national waste management strategy was needed \u2014 and formulated.", "address": "41 Upington, Cape Town, Northern Cape  South Africa", "details": {"Business Type": "Service provider", "Industry Type": "Waste Management", "Market Focus": "Locally (one state or province)"}, "panels": [{"title": "About us", "description": "The new integrated Waste Management Policy and the National Waste Management strategy seeks to minimise the waste stream going to landfills, while extracting maximum value from the waste stream at all stages of the collection and disposal process. The strategy also introduced a slew of rigorous new environmental regulations, designed to bring South Africa\u2019s waste management in line with the Best Environmental Practices In the world  As the biggest waste management company in Africa , Pikitup not only operates entirely within the strict new regulations stipulated by law, the company has also formulated and has commenced the implementation of its own sustainable integrated waste management strategy to turn Joburg into one of the cleanest cities in the world. Current world Best Practice standards dictate that only 10% of the waste stream should end up in landfills. The broad goal of Pikitup\u2019s strategy is to support the national vision of \u2018Zero waste to landfills by 2022\u2019. While it is a practically unattainable goal \u2014 some waste will always have to be disposed of at landfills \u2014 it nevertheless remains an ideal and focused goal.  Even a cursory glance at the numbers reveals the enormity of the challenge facing Pikitup. The 1625 square kilometre area of the City is home to 3,8 million people and around 787 000 dwellings. Apart from collecting and disposing of the domestic refuse generated by the city residents, Pikitup also offers commercial services to some 17 000 businesses in the city and litter picks and sweeps approximately 9 000 kilometres of streets within Joburg\u2019s eleven regions. The city generates a total of 1,6 million tons of waste per annum. To put some perspective on that figure, it\u2019s equal to the combined weight of Chicago\u2019s Sears Tower and New York\u2019s Empire State Building \u2014 doubled.  Pikitup's present services are restricted to the geographical area of the City of Johannesburg and is well equipped to meet Joburg's waste collection and disposal demands. The company has over 4 000 employees operating from 11 depots, with its fleet of around 500 vehicles constantly shuttling between customers, its 4 landfill sites, incinerator and 42 garden refuse sites across the city. Pikitup has modernised and improved waste collection systems by constantly upgrading its fleet, and has delivered 472 000 new 240 litre wheeled bins in the phased replacement of the old refuse bag system. Yet the challenge lies not just in the mere act of collecting and disposing of the city's waste, but also in how this is accomplished.  Recycling is key to the twin goals of minimising the waste going to landfills and extracting maximum value from the waste stream. Separating recyclable materials \u2014 glass, paper, metals and certain plastics \u2014 out of the waste stream reduces the bulk of waste going to landfills, eases the strain on our natural resources, and helps to create employment in both the informal and formalised waste reclamation sectors.  Pikitup works with recycling companies to launch and support recycling initiatives, particularly at community level. Pikitup\u2019s support has been vital in the establishment of five community-run recycling buy-back centres located across the city, and more centres are planned for the future. Pikitup is actively involved in recycling research, and is investigating recycling joint ventures with international partners. The company supports recycling and processing of green garden waste into soil-enhancing compost, via the recent establishment of its pilot Composting Plant at the Panorama site in Roodepoort.  As the official waste management company for Joburg, Pikitup provides services for the City\u2019s major events, such as the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Both events were a great success and, apart from the obvious benefits of presenting a clean and hygienic city image to Joburg\u2019s international guests, allowed Pikitup to showcase and refine its strategy, ensuring that the influx of visitors created no increase in the waste going to landfills.  While Pikitup has accepted custodianship of the city's cleanliness, the city's residents also have a vital role to play. Unfortunately, there is a pervasive mindset among Joburg citizens that tolerates littering and illegal dumping. The negative consequences of this mindset extend far beyond the visible blight of unhealthy illegal dumps. It costs the City R170 million per annum to clean up street littering and illegal dump sites - money that could be far better utilised on 7 350 RDP houses, 588 new ambulances or any number of other projects to bring the city up to world-class standards. Pikitup's ongoing 'Project 100 Spots' campaign is not only dedicated to cleaning up illegal dumping sites, but also informing communities about the hazards of illegal dumping, and encouraging them to take stewardship of these sites.  It is however not any one individual or company's job to turn Joburg into a world-class city, instead as our company\u2019s slogan states,  Serving you, saving our environment  Pikitup supports the City's goals fully, and also supports others who share the vision of a world-class Joburg. We welcome suggestions from any of our customers, the citizens of Joburg, on how to improve our service. In turn, we will gladly advise or assist businesses or other City roleplayers in solving their waste management issues. By working together with focused goals and a shared vision, there is no reason why we cannot turn Joburg into a truly world-leading city like Copenhagen or Singapore."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/absorbetech-environmental-88381", "id": "88381", "name": "Absorbetech Environmental", "description": "Absorbetech Environmental is the manufacturer of the hydrocarbon absorbent ABSORBETECH and our associated products.\u00a0We are a South African company based in Durban, KwaZulu Natal, with representation via a number of distribution agents locally and internationally.\u00a0Absorbetch is manufactured locally from the waste stream of an existing industry and thus does not add to the depletion of our natural resources, nor will it harm our environment as it is totally biodegradable.", "address": "22 Palmgate Crescent, Durban, Amanzimtoti  South Africa", "details": {"Business Type": "Manufacturer", "Industry Type": "Oil Spills", "Market Focus": "Internationally (various countries)"}, "panels": []}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/pioneer-pump-franklin-electric-co-inc-8040", "id": "8040", "name": "Pioneer Pump - Franklin Electric Co., Inc.", "description": "Our story started in 1998, when four dedicated professionals set out to build a new company with a single-minded focus on superior hydraulic performance.

Eco Global Sales is a privately held company founded in 2007 on the core belief that eco-friendly, non-toxic waste treatment products have become a necessity in today\u2019s environmentally sensitive and fragile ecosystem.\nUnlike liquid treatment systems, these tablets fall to the bottom of the tank for treatment, and dissolve over time releasing the multifunctional chemicals. The tablets are designed to dissolve slowly through the use of natural water soluble polymers and synthetic non-hazardous polymer binders. All of the ingredients in the tablets are environmentally safe and do not require any special permitting to meet effluent or pretreatment requirements.   The tablets dissolve releasing sodium carbonate peroxydate, a solid form of hydrogen peroxide. The subsequent release of oxygen causes an immediate bubbling action that disperses the oxygen throughout the tank. The sodium carbonate portion of the salt then buffers the water to a neutral pH. The oxygen released reacts immediately with any hydrogen sulfide (and other sulfides, thiols, and mercaptans) creating non-toxic sodium sulfate and various salts of the organic sulfides. The oxygenation of the water mitigates sulfide odors and ultimately prevents the corrosion of pipes, pumps, and valves due to the elimination of the acid hydrogen sulfide and other naturally occurring acids in the wastewater. Because the tablet descends to the bottom of the tank, the action of the tablet during the dissolution causes bubbling within the bottom sludge. The combination of the oxygenation and buffering of the water, bubbling action, and the release of aerobic bacteria initiates the biodegradation of the oil and grease and other organic sludge. In a system with constant flow, a scheduled application of eco-tabsTM will remove the oil and grease sludge completely, leaving only solids the will not degrade or breakdown (e.g. plastic applicators, bottle caps, etc).

We have clients with assets monitored by ROAM in 28 countries on 5 continents. Our clients are served by our 4 offices in Dubai (UAE), Bonn (Germany), Cairo (Egypt) and Atlanta, GA (USA). Our core software development and R&D team are based in our Bonn office.Our company has come to view itself after many years in this Industry as a thought-leader in the M2M/Pervasive Computing space.We are network and hardware agnostic whereby we have the flexibility and expertise with our ROAM platform, to integrate variable networks (GSM, satellite, etc) or hardware vendors. We can help navigate an ever-growing list of networks and hardware and easily integrate new ones as they arise. This agnosticism was part of our architectural design philosophy for ROAM from day one.The deep integration between ROAM, our applications, networks and hardware which we have refined over the past 10+ years also extends to existing software systems at client sites. We have seamlessly integrated our ROAM-based solutions with various ERP, financial and other 3rd party applications. We continue to witness the M2M industry going through various stages and we believe it is still very much a nascent field in need of standards.Our mission is to make ROAM the M2M industry standard platform for managing remote asset communications.TechnologyMore than 10 years ago, when our ROAM platform was being initially architected, we decided to adopt the well-known Agile Development Methodology which calls for an ongoing and shortened development cycle, which in our case results in ROAM releases every 5 weeks. This means that our clients benefit from enhancements and new features seamlessly, every 5 weeks\u2026at no additional charge.ROAM is cloud-based (although we also offer a locally-based solution, if needed). This removes the burden of maintaining servers, hardware, bandwidth, trouble-shooting, etc. from our clients so that they can focus on their core businesses.Moreover, due to the intelligent design of ROAM, when our clients require custom applications to run on ROAM, we typically design, develop, test and deploy these in 4-6 weeks. This flexibility and deployment speed are critical as new M2M challenges disrupt existing businesses and also offer them an opportunity to be more efficient in many areas.Naturally, we also have a variety of existing applications on offer for various industries in our library.We feel strongly that the key to any successful technology solution is the software that binds all the hardware, communications, etc. components together. Hence, we focused on building an extremely powerful software platform that combines:\nAll of the above results in ROAMWORKS offering both standard and customizable solutions across a nearly limitless range of industries.True PartnershipWe know the term is overused and, indeed, abused, but \u201cpartnership\u201d is key to our joint success. We believe that while our clients may not know exactly what kind of a solution is best for their needs, they do know exactly how their businesses work; much better than we or any other solution provider does.We tap into that business knowledge in order to better understand the challenges facing our clients and then match the relevant technologies and solutions to them. Once implemented, these new industry-specific applications become part of our overall library and we pass on those industry-specific (as opposed to client-specific) benefits and lessons learned to all our clients in the form of ROAM platform enhancements and regular updates.We take a consultative partnership approach and this means that no matter how technologically sophisticated or not your operation is, we adapt ourselves, our recommendations and our solutions accordingly. We understand that organizations go through different cycles and at different speeds. Our aim is to link with them regardless of where they are and grow with them because we realize that the M2M industry is in flux and no one can accurately predict what problems and solutions will arise in the coming years. As future challenges emerge, we will tackle them together, as partners.Our focus is to have our software platform, ROAM, and its applications designed to be able to rapidly adapt to known circumstances today and, as yet unknown ones, in the future. To best accomplish this, long-term partnerships with our clients are key.By working closely with customers with the objective of being \u201cpartners for life\u201d. We are interested in long-term relationships with clients whereby we learn about each others\u2019 business and apply that knowledge towards relevant and comprehensive solutions for them. At times, neither of us may know exactly how future trends and technologies will impact the business, but we want to be tackling these future challenges together. Our consultative approach with our clients is key to our success.This cooperation also extends to our company being an aggregator of whatever tools (hardware, networks, etc.) & systems integration needed to make the best possible solution for our clients with ROAM as the foundation.Empowered EmployeesWithout our team, ROAMWORKS would not be where we are today. We aim to hire and retain the smartest, most talented and dedicated people we can find. Moreover, we empower our people to do their respective jobs better, thereby improving our company overall and enhancing our customers\u2019 experiences in the process.Our growing ROAMWORKS team in our 4 offices hails from 17 countries on 6 continents. This diversity is one of our greatest assets and differentiates us from many other firms.

By providing this type of environment, we believe our team will be more creative, satisfied and deliver what is best for the company.We demand input, feedback and communication from our team with the overall aim of making ROAMWORKS better. It\u2019s not enough just to fulfill our stated job descriptions; we must always think of what would make our firm an even better place to work in.We also demand that our team protect this special corporate culture by giving back 110% and keeping complacency and negative attitudes at bay.We all ask ourselves on a daily basis, \u201cHow can I enrich our customers\u2019 experience?\u201dBE/SEBy using our Business Expert (BE) plus Systems Expert (SE) system. Each customer account is assigned a BE and SE who evaluate and develop various solutions for their specific market segment. This team leads the analysis, development, project management, integration and delivery of solutions.The BE/SE team INITIALLY takes FROM and FINALLY contributes TO our application library every time a project is concluded. Our library should have a net gain after each project due to new business knowledge we would have attained from that new customer and/or vertical.Relentless with ROAMBy continuously enhancing our platform, ROAM, to cater for the obvious and not yet obvious needs of clients in the M2M market.

Instrumentation for building acoustics has later been of the primary sources for our successful business.\nIn the first part of the 80-ies, sound intensity measurements become very popular among acoustician\u2019s. As one of the forefront suppliers in this new field, Norsonic offered the ultrasound Nor216 Sound Intensity Microphone together with the portable dual channel Nor830 Real-Time Analyser for this growing market. Thanks to these unique and innovative products, the export markets for Norsonic expanded to both North-America and Asia.\nBy the introduction of the Nor110 Sound Analyser in the late 80-ies, Norsonic entered into the Environmental Noise market. This step was followed up by the company\u2019s first handheld sound level meter in the early 90-ies \u2013 the Nor116 Sound Level Meter.\nDuring the last part of the 80-ies, the world learned to know the fantastic possibilities with PC\u2019s. So, for Norsonic, the logical step was to build the PC together with the precision acoustical instrumentation. The world\u2019s first combination of such was introduced in the first part of the 90-ies by the dual channel Nor840 Real-Time Analyser. And in the last part of the 90-ies, the smaller sister for environmental noise \u2013 the Nor121 Sound Analyser with true audio recording \u2013 was entering the market.\nShortly after the start of the new century, Norsonic introduced the small handheld Nor118 Sound Level Meter with real-time filters. This became the true working tool for all acoustic consultants, and was further improved in 2007 with additional features in our biggest success so far \u2013 the Nor140 Sound Analyser.

On the morning of March 26, 1912, the Jed Mine in West Virginia exploded. In a flash, methane gas ignited and more than 80 miners lost their lives. From this tragedy, mine engineer John T. Ryan Sr. had an epiphany: \u201cIf I could spend my life doing what I can to lessen the likelihood of the occurrence of such terrible disasters, I shall feel in the end that my life had been well spent.\u201dRyan recruited colleague George H. Deike to help realize his vision for a new company. Recognizing the critical importance of dependable, safe mining equipment, they went straight to one of the country\u2019s great thinkers: Thomas Edison. The brilliant inventor helped Ryan and Deike create the electric cap lamp which, over the next 25 years, reduced mine explosions by an astounding 75 percent. Of all his inventions, this was the one that did the most for humanity, Edison would later say in life.In the decades that have come and gone, MSA has continued to lead the charge for workplace safety. We\u2019ve led the way with small first-aid kits and portable methane detectors, and harnessed new technologies to produce state-of-the-art thermal imaging cameras, ballistic helmets, and leading edge systems for gas and flame detection.But we\u2019ve never forgotten where we came from, or why we\u2019re here. We\u2019re called The Safety Company for a reason \u2013 a very important reason: Our goal, every single day, is to provide our customers with dependable, high-quality products, instruments, and service to help ensure a safe return home at the end of each work day."}, {"title": "Our Values", "description": "Our MissionMSA\u2019s mission is to see to it that men and women may work in safety and that they, their families, and their communities may live in health throughout the world.Embracing Change and Encouraging InnovationMSA is an organization fully committed to protecting the health and safety of our customers, and we spend countless hours developing, testing, and evaluating our products to ensure we achieve our goals.

In the early 1960s the first sprayer with engine axles ventilators and steel tanks are produced and the success is so high that in 1973 Danilo\u2019s son, Giuseppe Faccio, enlarges the enterprise and moves to another area. And thanks to Giuseppe and his brothers, who have new and fresh ideas, new and promising machines for crops protection are introduced. Indeed, in the 1970s the first low volume sprayers are produced, and are particularly aimed at medium and low volume treatments on vineyards (and/or other crops with similar plantation systems).\nIdeal\u2019s growth and development continues, also thanks to the production of pneumatic equipments for pruning and olives harvesting, so much that in 1992 stubborn and dynamic Giuseppe Faccio decides to enlarge the factory once more. This time Ideal company moves to Castelbaldo (Padua) in new headquarters occupying an area of 8,000 sq m., of which 4,000 re covered. The new factory is settled in a close town, not only to preserve employment of current employees but also to maintain both know-how and expertise learnt during the previous years of activity.

Lowering tapes down the well can be challenging. The tapes get caught and hungup on wires and pipes. They get false indications from cascading water and condensation. And it is labor intensive reeling the tapes down and back up. Then there are the decontamination issues. Pushing a tape down a crooked or sloped well can be nearly impossible. The submersible pressure transducers have similar issues with the added uncertainty about their location and reliability.Then there are the acoustic or sonic devices which send sound pulses into the well. While they are very convenient and fast, they are susceptable to imperfections in the well such as open perforations, open fissures or pockets, or even pipe fittings on the drop pipe, all of which can cause incorrect readings.The bottom line is that there is not a perfect solution for every well. But where the tape may not be able to fall into a sloped well, the sound pulse has no problems. And where the sound pulse is lost in an open fissure, the tape may go right past.While the submersible technologies have been well established, the acoustic or sonic meters have left room for improvement. This is where our story begins.One of the biggest problems with the sonic meters is that the sound pulses tend to travel in straight lines and reflect off any imperfection in its path. The degree to which it does so is a function of the sound frequency. The higher the frequency, the more directional the beam, and the smaller the obstruction that will reflect the sound. Ultrasonic detectors are commonly used for measuring streams from bridges and levels in tanks through open air. This is possible because the very high frequency sound travels as a beam in the direction it is launched. It is also able to detect small objects crossing the beam. It cannot detect the water level through a pipe, however, because the ultrasonic beam takes many paths through the pipe. A very small part of the beam travels straight through the pipe, while part takes one bounce off the wall, and some may bounce 20 times making the path much longer. This is combined with the reflections from every pipe seam and wire bend in the pipe. The net result is noise."}, {"title": "Other sonic meters have been developed for measuri...", "description": "Other sonic meters have been developed for measuring through pipes using a much lower frequency sound close to 200hz. At this frequency, the sound waves spread out and pretty much fill the space available to them. This makes it unsuitable for measuring a stream level from a bridge or level in a tank for example. But when confined to a pipe, the wave fills the pipe and travels as a single wave, eliminating the multipath issue with the ultrasonic waves.\nBut even at this frequency, small imperfections cause a significant portion of the sound pulse to be reflected and can appear like it has reflected off the water. Here is where Eno Scientific has taken this sonic technology to the next level. The Eno Scientific Well Sounders were developed to use an even lower frequency, down to 50hz. At these frequencies, the sound pulse acts more like you would expect from an air pressure wave. At these slow speeds, the air fills all the space along the route flowing around obstacles. The reflections from most pipe couplings and minor obstructions become insignificant.\nWhy doesn't everyone do it this way? The advantages are obvious. The answer is that it is much harder to do. Generating a clean low frequency pulse is more difficult. It is also much more difficult to determine the exact location of a slowly changing pressure wave than a quick one. Eno Scientific was able to solve these problems using powerful digital signal processing techniques and electronics."}, {"title": "Not only has Eno Scientific raised the bar in its ...", "description": "Not only has Eno Scientific raised the bar in its ability to use very low frequency pulses to measure the depth to the water, but also in the standard features included to make the users job easier.

It was a 12-inch capacity Model 100 Brush Bandit.\u00a0   That machine was built in a 6,000 square-foot converted repair shop, with the support of six employees.\u00a0Upon its completion, Mike embarked on a\u00a015,000-mile tour to market his creation, receiving his first order for five chippers in December of 1983.\u00a0Mike,\u00a0along with his wife and co-owner Dianne Morey,\u00a0launched the company in what seemed like a blink of an eye, and the cuddly raccoon decal on each machine soon became \u201cBandit\u201d\u2014 the well-known face of the company. Throughout Bandit headquarters in mid-Michigan you can see images of the famous raccoon in photographs, paintings, pictures and wood carvings, of which many are\u00a0gifts from dealers and customers as a token of appreciation for years of service, dedication and support.\nThe Bandit Campus: That first 6,000-square foot stand-alone building was soon eclipsed, with a company expansion taking places on average every two years to accommodate and facilitate growth.\u00a0That expansion still continues\u2013present manufacturing facilities exceed 280,000 square feet at two mid-Michigan locations, Millbrook and North Winn.\u00a0The\u00a0most recent expansion was completed in the spring of 2015 at the whole tree chipper manufacturing facility.\u00a0  Made in Michigan, Used World-Wide: Bandit Industries, Inc. is a full-line manufacturer of unique hand-fed and whole tree chippers, stump grinders, waste reduction Beast recycler units, high-powered forestry mowers and specialty equipment like the Model 60FM forestry mulch attachment for skid-steer loaders. All equipment is built at Bandit\u2019s mid-Michigan location near Mount Pleasant and is sold in over 50 countries, literally covering every portion of the globe.\nTalent: With each expansion, Bandit sought out and hired hardworking, local talent to keep growing in the right direction. Jerry Morey and Dennis Tracy joined the Bandit team in 1987, becoming part-owners with Mike and Dianne. With Dianne Morey serving as Bandit's human resources director, the company grew to over 200 employees in the late 1990s. That growth reached new heights in 2010, with the company's global workforce nearly doubling in the three years that followed. With Rosie Ebbinghaus\u00a0serving as HR director, Bandit currently employs approximately 500 people. Bandit's strength lies heavily in the quality and commitment of the employees, many of whom have been with the company for over 20\u00a0years and have grown with Bandit to become managers.  Whole Tree Chippers: In the early 1990s, Bandit introduced whole tree chippers for tree service and land clearing contractors. Through regular contact and feedback from customers, Bandit has continually led the whole tree chipping market for durability, reliability and performance. Disc and drum-style whole tree chippers are available with capacities up to 36 inches in diameter and over 1,000 horsepower, filling\u00a050-foot trailers with chips in as little as seven minutes. Innovations in chipper design, aggressive feed systems, and features like optional loaders or self-propelled undercarriages further make Bandit whole tree chippers the class leaders that so many companies appreciate.  Beast Horizontal Grinders / Recyclers: In 1995, the Beast entered the scene. These unique waste reduction machines have become extremely popular in the tree care, land clearing, municipal and recycling industries.\u00a0They are also ideally suited for biomass operations. The patented cuttermill system provides the ability to cut, split or grind waste material into valuable products, ranging from conventional wood chips to mulch, asphalt, and a unique product called Bio-Sawdust\u2014a \u00bc-inch minus material ideal for wood pellet production.\nStump Grinders: The first Bandit stump grinder was introduced in 2003 at the annual Tree Care Industry (TCI)\u00a0Expo.\u00a0\u00a0Available as towable units, self-propelled with wheels or high-flotation track crawlers, Bandit's comprehensive line of stump grinders are industry leaders for the tree care, rental and landscaping industries.\nForestry Mowers / Mulchers: Experience with stump grinders in the land clearing and site development markets led Bandit to develop a line of extremely capable, high-capacity track carriers. These versatile machines can wield either a large stump grinder head or a high-capacity forestry mower, all designed in-house by Bandit with the goal of providing high-power, high-production land clearing for forest thinning operations, pipeline and utility clearing, agricultural reclamation and much more. They are able to clear large areas in dense, difficult terrain.\nBiomass: Bandit Industries has long been a proponent and strong supporter of renewable, carbon-neutral biomass energy. Bandit continues to work closely with professionals in the biomass industry to develop whole tree chippers, Beast recyclers and other specialty equipment ideally suited for the production of biomass fuel. High-quality, specifically sized wood chips are vital for biomass boilers and fuel wood markets to achieve the highest levels of efficiency.\u00a0Bandit\u00a0is a global\u00a0industry leader in the production of\u00a0these specific materials, serving biomass operations from pellet mills to direct-fire biomass boilers large and small, all around the world.  Hand-Fed Brush Chippers: Bandit's claim to fame has been the hydraulic-feed hand-fed brush chipper. They form the backbone of more than 50,000 Bandit machines sold and in operation all around the world. With numerous styles and sizes to choose from, Bandit's comprehensive line of hand fed chippers favoured by companies large and small, from the local tree care specialist to landscapers, large scale land clearers and loggers.\u00a0   Dealer Network: Bandit simply has the best dealer network in the industry, with locations all around the world to serve customers directly. Bandit dealers provide valuable services and support to their customers on the front lines thanks to extensive factory training in both sales and service, ensuring that customers receive the best equipment and follow-up support possible. Recent company growth has seen this dealer network expand rapidly; since 2011 Bandit has added a new dealer nearly every month on average. There are currently over 160 Bandit dealer locations in over 50 countries.  Bandit Customers: In the end, Bandit's customers have remained the number one priority. 'We pride ourselves on the number of repeat customers who buy and rent our equipment,' said Bandit Industries President Jerry Morey. 'Listening to the ideas and suggestions of those who use our equipment has led to the development of many of our products. We consider our relationship with our customers a partnership.

He was working on a long metal pipe that held round bottom flasks for a local grain laboratory to remove acid fumes. The process was known as Kjeldahl nitrogen determination.\nThe salesman and the inventor formed a partnership named Laboratory Construction Company. Their mission\u2014to build and sell Kjeldahl apparatus to the numerous milling companies in the area.\nEarly years were lean, but the company survived and added new products. Carts. Tables. Goldfisch Fat Extractors.\nIn 1939, Ralph\u2019s son, Redman, joined the business. During his 60-year career, his brand of building relationships, serving customers and caring for people helped the company thrive.\nIn 1957, Labconco, as we came to be called, outgrew the garage and moved to our present headquarters in south Kansas City. The modern era began.\nWe expanded from agricultural labs into other scientific markets. In the 1960s, Labconco introduced a series of fume hoods. They were lined with durable molded fiberglass, a signature feature still found in our Protector Premier line.

You can add Labconco to the list.Our company began in a small garage in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. In 1925, Ralph Callaway (right), a salesman and entrepreneur, stopped in to have his car battery repaired. Philip Goldfisch, an engineer and inventor, of sorts, operated the garage. Ralph noticed an unusual apparatus in the back\u2014a long metal pipe for a local grain laboratory to remove acid fumes during Kjeldahl determination. It piqued Ralph\u2019s interest.The two formed a partnership, named Laboratory Construction Company, to build Kjeldahl apparatus for the numerous milling companies in the area. The early years were lean, but the company survived and new products were added. Carts. Tables. The patented Goldfisch Fat Extractor. In 1939, Ralph\u2019s son, Redman (left), joined the business and left an indelible mark throughout his 60-year career with the company. In 1957, Labconco, as we came to be called, outgrew the garage and moved to our present headquarters in south Kansas City. The modern era began.We branched out from agricultural labs into other scientific markets. In the 1960\u2019s, Labconco introduced a series of fume hoods lined with durable molded one-piece fiberglass, a signature feature found in our current Protector Premier line. Other equipment made with molded fiberglass, such as glove boxes, quickly followed.At the same time, we formed enduring relationships with laboratory supply dealers. Our dealers expanded our geographic reach and provided innovative product ideas suggested by end users.New products are the lifeblood of our company and spurred our growth. In 1969, we introduced a glassware washer. In 1974 came a line of freeze dryers. In 1976, our first biological safety cabinet premiered. In 1984, water purification systems were added. In 1989, we acquired Buchler Instruments, and with it, the expertise to add evaporation and centrifugal concentration to our family of products. One of our latest innovations, introduced in 2014, is the Purifier Axiom, the first Class II, Type C1 Biological Safety Cabinet in the world. The list continues to grow as we improve upon existing lines and develop new ones.In 1989, we added a manufacturing facility in Fort Scott, Kansas, ninety miles south of Kansas City. The company founded by two individuals now has more than 250 associates. An idea that started in a small garage in the Midwest now has placed equipment in laboratories worldwide.Throughout our history, we\u2019ve held onto the core values instilled by Redman Callaway: integrity, highest quality standards, and exceptional customer service. We are sincerely thankful to our customers, dealer partners and vendors throughout the years who have made our success possible, including you. With you, we intend to last another 90 years and beyond.\n"}, {"title": "Our Values", "description": "Labconco makes some of the best laboratory equipment in the world.

This technique involves directing a straight beam of light through a glass tube full of the sample on test. Our algorithms calculate the oil content based on the amount of light scatter detected at the optical receivers located at specific locations around the glass tube.\nMicroscopy\nDetermination of oil concentration by measuring the droplet size through image processing and recognition software. For this method, we use a microscope to look at the sample at a rate of three images per second. These images are then analysed by our software which can determine the visible differences between oil, gas and solids. The software will then determine the size and quantity of each object and display an accurate oil measurement, disregarding unwanted interference from gas and solids.\nFluorescence\nFluorescence is a very accurate technique for detecting oil in water. A straight beam of Ultra violet light at a known wavelength is directed into a glass tube filled with the sample on test. When oil droplets are excited by ultraviolet light, they will emit light at a different wavelength. Detectors located at very specific angles around the glass tube detect the light fluoresced from the oil. With the information from these detectors, our sophisticated algorithms can determine the oil content of the sample.\nUltra Sonics\nUltra-sonics is ideally suited to applications where optical detection principles will not cope, such as solid particles in heavy oils. For this technique, we direct an ultrasonic transducer into our sample where solid particles within the sample will scatter the ultrasonic waves. Ultrasonic receivers in certain positions will detect the ultrasonic feedback and our mathematical formulas can then calculate the concentration of contaminants."}, {"title": "Marine and Industrial Accreditations", "description": "Rivertrace Marine products meet standards of the following accreditations:\nMARPOL 73/78IMO resolution MEPC 107(49)IMO resolution MEPC 108(49)\nRivertrace Industrial products meet standards of the following accreditations:\nVarious National Standards including\u00a0CSA, DNV, LLOYDS, SIRE\nAll Rivertrace products are built and supported by ISO-9001:2015 Accreditation."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/ncc-environmental-services-pty-ltd-67109", "id": "67109", "name": "NCC Environmental Services (Pty) Ltd", "description": "NCC Environmental Services is a leading environmental consultancy and valued strategic partner to some of Southern Africa`s most respected environmental experts, engineering and construction companies.

A year later, the first overseas long-term assignment was implemented in Ethiopia and for several years, ORGUT supported rural development there. A steadily growing portfolio expanded from the initial forestry and sustainable land use support work to large integrated rural development, land administration and water sector projects. In the 80\u2019s, ORGUT ventured into West and East Africa focusing on food security, land management and local governance. Various successful long and short term projects established ORGUT firmly as the leading Swedish consultant and project management specialist in rural development. Geographical coverage soon encompassed some fifty countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. ORGUT also offered International Training Programmes in forestry and continued to implement rural development consultancies and environmental certification of forest products in Sweden.Three decades of rural project management experience had prepared ORGUT for the expansion into sector reforms and policy review in a new generation of projects. These projects linked best practices in decentralised natural resource management along with rights-based approaches, to national or regional reform. Large natural resource and market-led income generation projects expanded to Latin America and in South East Asia. Combining good governance and equitable access to natural resources remained a core element in many assignments as for example in the Sida funded LAMP. In 2002, the UNDP Equator Initiative Prize was awarded to the nine LAMP supported SULEDO villages for the sustainable management of community forests. By then, many ORGUT projects in sustainable agriculture, forestry and land use planning had introduced climate change mitigation and adaptation before these terms were widely adopted. As a recognized natural resource governance specialist and efficient project manager, ORGUT became increasingly engaged in large-scale water and sanitation sector projects in East and Southern Africa and the Middle East. In parallel, ORGUT saw strong growth in land administration, management and reform assignments in Eastern Europe and East Africa. Democratic governance and decentralization programmes, already initiated in the 90\u2019s at local levels reached national coverage in Tanzania and Vietnam. In the last decade ORGUT has also established itself as a service provider in private sector development services including market development, value chains and microfinance in Eastern Europe and Africa.ORGUT has always been, and still is, fully owned and controlled by its staff. This creates a strong professional and managerial commitment with a remarkably low staff turnover, guaranteeing continuity in results-oriented service delivery. The company\u2019s solid institutional memory is highly useful for concept, method and approach development. An ISO 9001 Certification increased stability and transparency in management and administration. ORGUT established a branch office in Vietnam in 1994. Since then, ORGUT Kenya Ltd based in Nairobi was established as well as representative offices in Tanzania, Ethiopia and South Africa. In 2010, the company concentrated its growing land administration portfolio and expertise at ORGUT UK Ltd. In 2011, ORGUT Finland Oy was established with offices in Helsinki, building on ORGUT\u2019s aim of further develop its provision of consulting services to MFA Finland. Over the years, ORGUT\u2019s client and partner base has broadened steadily and ORGUT now cooperates with a wide range of multilateral and bilateral donors, country ministries, research institutes and the private sector.

For unmanned water monitoring the AquaLogger has enough memory to capture up to 15,000 full data sets and battery life is in the range of 6 \u2013 12 months, depending on the measurement frequency. The\u00a0AquaLogger is designed for use in the field and has a built in air pressure sensor to automatically compensate various recordings for barometric pressure."}, {"title": "Groundwater & Water Level", "description": "Groundwater & Water Level\nThere are many reasons why you might want to conduct testing or water quality monitoring of groundwater. For example, you might wish to undertake groundwater modelling for a particular area to understand aquifer hydraulics. Parameters such as rhodamine are used to understand the movement of water underground. Groundwater testing would also be used to examine the effects, if any, of human activities. Leachate from landfill can find its way into groundwater, as can fertilisers from agriculture. Monitoring groundwater quality can identify the existence of a pollutant in order to mitigate any possible harmful effects.\nThe slimline design of the probes mean that they can fit into the smallest boreholes. The\u00a0AP-2000\u00a0is less than 2\u2033 in diameter. Combined with an\u00a0AquaLogger\u00a0that collects the data from the Aquaprobe\u00a0you can leave the devices in-situ for months on end. With groundwater testing it\u2019s common to pump water up into flow cells and then take readings from the water in the cell. We produce our flow cells from highly durable marine grade aluminium.\nIt is important to measure ground water levels using dedicated water level loggers across wide areas to fully understand and to characterise aquifers and the water table. Doing so allows you to record changes to normal levels which can then be investigated. Besides Aquifer characterisation there are many other applications where precise water level measurement is required:"}, {"title": "Surface Water", "description": "Surface Water\nWe have a wide range of water testing equipment that is used to record trends across different water quality parameters in water bodies such as streams, lakes and rivers, as well as in seawater. Understanding these trends means that when there is a change it could be an early warning that there is a pollutant in the water or there has been a change in the aquatic ecosystem. Early detection is necessary to put mitigating measures in place.\nOur parameters are wide ranging, although the most commonly measured in surface water testing and monitoring are dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity and temperature, which are standard on most Aquaprobes. If you require specific parameters to be tested, there is the option to add additional parameters.\nPortable\nFor the ultimate in portable multiparameter water quality testing, look no further than our\u00a0AP-2000, which measures all the essential parameters in a handheld device. The AP-2000 can be used in conjunction with our\u00a0GPS Aquameter\u00a0that records the exact location of each data set so that once back in the lab you can view all your locations on Google Maps. If you need to measure a larger number of parameters, the\u00a0AP-5000\u00a0offers four auxiliary ports, two more than the AP-2000, and also measures depth. The AP-5000 is still portable and has many applications with a diameter of only 55mm.\nFixed monitoring\nBoth the AP-2000 and AP-5000 are suitable for short to medium term unmanned monitoring. The probes are connected to our AquaLogger, which has the capacity to capture data to months on end. If you require long term water quality monitoring, the\u00a0AP-7000\u00a0is specifically designed for this: it even cleans itself. The AP-7000 is used with the larger capacity\u00a0AquaLogger\u00a0and with a telemetry system that sends the data directly to your desk."}, {"title": "Waste Water Testing", "description": "Waste Water Testing\nThere is strict regulation surrounding waste water discharge so it\u2019s very important to conduct\u00a0waste water testing in waste water environments. Aquatic ecosystems are sensitive to even small changes in the chemical make up of the water, temperature, etc. Water parameter testing before discharge allows any pollutants to be detected and prevented from entering the watercourse. Real time testing allows quick action and minimises the risk of any potential fines that might be imposed by regulatory bodies should there be any regulatory violations. The rugged\u00a0AP-2000\u00a0protects the electrodes during deployment and allows all the essential parameters to be tested while it\u2019s portable design means that the device can be easily carried between locations. You can also save money on site visits by using telemetry.\nThe\u00a0AP-7000\u00a0self-cleaning probe can be hooked up to a telemetry device that uploads all the data online so that it can be accessed wherever and whenever you need it.

The HORIBA Radio Laboratory built the capacitor needed for the high-speed calculator (computer in today\u2019s terms) for nuclear physics experiments. This capacitor became renowned for its functions and quality, and HORIBA decided to start manufacturing it commercially. However, construction of the factory was halted by the steep rise in the cost of materials due to the conflict in Korea. The only thing to be done was to market the pH meter they had built to control the pH value of the capacitor\u2019s electrolyte. This pH meter was extremely well-received and before he knew it HORIBA was famous as a maker of pH meters. In 1953, eight years after the formation of the HORIBA Radio Laboratory, HORIBA, Ltd. was established and took its first steps as a manufacturer of measurement instruments."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/digital-weighing-scales-shop-in-kampala-uganda-112092", "id": "112092", "name": "Digital Weighing Scales Shop in Kampala Uganda", "description": "Eagle Weighing Scales Company presents and delivers state of the art scales as well as traditional scales at the most affordable prices. \nThese are just some of the many types of scales we carry: digital scales, mini palm sized scales, pocket scales, bathroom scales, weighing scales, weigh scale, specialty scales, balance scales, diet scales, shipping scales, Tanita scales, ohaus scales, counting scales, baby scales, gram scales, portable scales, body fat scales, crane scales, electronic scales, travel scales, floor scales, kitchen scales, wholesale scales, and triple beam scales. \nFor any further inquiries, mail or contact us \nAddress: Wandegeya University Plaza Room A18\nFor orders and deliveries please contact us on : +256 (0) 700225423\n+256 (0) 787089315\nOr email us at;eagleweighingsystems@gmail.com \n", "address": "    Uganda", "details": {"Business Type": "Distributor", "Industry Type": "Commercial", "Market Focus": "Globally (various continents)", "Year Founded": "2006", "Employees": "11-100", "Turnover": "$10,000,000 US - $100,000,000 US"}, "panels": [{"title": "Weighing scales company in Uganda", "description": "\ufeff\nEagle Weighing Scales Company presents and delivers state of the art scales as well as traditional scales at the most affordable prices.\nThese are just some of the many types of scales we carry: digital scales, mini palm sized scales, pocket scales, bathroom scales, weighing scales, weigh scale, specialty scales, balance scales, diet scales, shipping scales, Tanita scales, ohaus scales, counting scales, baby scales, gram scales, portable scales, body fat scales, crane scales, electronic scales, travel scales, floor scales, kitchen scales, wholesale scales, and triple beam scales."}, {"title": "What is the price of a weighing scale in Kampala ?", "description": "Eagle Weighing Scales can help you find the scale that fits your needs and your budget.

The cyclone models were sold to industrial, water treatment, mining and other industries.Today, KREBS pumps, cyclones and valves are sold in almost every country on the globe.

In December of 1950, they purchased the rights to a cyclone like device called the Centriclone from an inventor named Norris Goodwin.The Company was incorporated as Equipment Engineers in 1952, Dick Krebs, Kelly\u2019s brother, was brought into the company later that year. In 1953, Equipment Engineers sold the rights to the Centriclone to Oliver Filters, a company that was later merged into The Dorr Company to become Dorr-Oliver. With the money from the sale of the Centriclone, the Company was able to develop the concept of the first heavy-duty mining cyclone, which had cast metal housings and replaceablemolded gum rubber liners.Equipment Engineers sold its first commercial cyclone in 1953. It was a Model EE10-4 Cyclone sold to Sandy Muller Aggregate in Orange, California with serial no. 1000 (I guess they didn\u2019t want Sandy Muller to feel like they were buying the first cyclone). In 1959, Kelly and Bob decided to split the Company into two separate companies.Bob Clarkson took the valve and reagent feeder products and incorporated as The Clarkson Company.\nKrebs Products in the Early Days\nRichard and Kelly kept the cyclone line and the Company grew into what we know it as today, the world\u2019s leading supplier of hydrocyclones, with offices in eight countries.The Company changed its name from Equipment Engineers to Krebs Engineers in 1965 in honor of Dick and Kelly Krebs.

As the first global environmental union, it brought together governments and civil society organisations with a shared goal to protect nature. Its aim was to encourage international cooperation and provide scientific knowledge and tools to guide conservation action.\nDuring the first decade of its existence, IUCN\u2019s primary focus was to examine the impact of human activities on nature. It flagged the damaging effects of pesticides on biodiversity, and promoted the use of environmental impact assessments, which have since become the norm across sectors and industries.\nMuch of IUCN\u2019s subsequent work in the 1960s and 1970s was devoted to the protection of species and the habitats necessary for their survival. In 1964, IUCN established the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, which has since evolved into the world\u2019s most comprehensive data source on the global extinction risk of species.\nIUCN also played a fundamental role in the creation of key international conventions, including the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (1971), the World Heritage Convention (1972), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, (1974) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992).\nIn 1980, IUCN \u2013 in partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) \u2013 published the\u00a0World Conservation Strategy, a ground-breaking document which helped define the concept of \u2018sustainable development\u2019 and shaped the global conservation and sustainable development agenda.\nA subsequent version of the strategy,\u00a0Caring for the Earth,\u00a0was published by the three organisations in the run-up to the 1992 Earth Summit. It served as the basis for international environmental policy and guided the creation of the Rio Conventions on biodiversity (CBD), climate change (UNFCCC) and desertification (UNCCD).\nIn 1999, as environmental issues continued to gain importance at the international stage, IUCN was granted official observer status to the United Nations. Today it remains the only environmental organisation with such status.\nIn the early 2000s, IUCN developed its business engagement strategy. Prioritising sectors with a significant impact on nature and livelihoods, such as mining and oil and gas, its aim is to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable.\nLater in the 2000s, IUCN pioneered \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 \u2013 actions to conserve nature which also address global challenges, such as food and water security, climate change and poverty reduction.\nToday, with the expertise and reach of its more than 1,300 Members \u2013 including States, government agencies, NGOs and Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Organisations \u2013 and over 10,000 international experts, IUCN is the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network.

One of the barriers preventing a circular economy around tires are quantities \u2013 almost 3 million tires are discarded in the United States alone, annually.\n\u201cTake them to the landfill,\u201d you say? Sure, but most landfills require you to cut a tire into at least three sections before accepting it. When buried, tires trap methane gasses inside of them and tend to work their way up toward the surface. This causes problems at landfills because they take up excessive amounts of space and tear through liners that are meant to stop hazardous chemicals from leaching into the ground. \u201cCan\u2019t you burn the tires?\u201d Burning tires in an uncontrolled environment releases toxic compounds into the air.\nSo, what can we do with all of these tires?

The increased adoption of IT as educational, communications and commerce tools implies that more people will need to acquire or use e-products to facilitate their daily transactions and living, thus increasing the amount of e-wastes generated every year.The launch of the MSC e-waste project will be backed up with an integrated Public Relations Campaign to encourage and enlist the support of the populace in \u201cdiscarding\u201d their stored e-waste.Several Seminars have been held in conjuction with LASEPA since 2008 to create public awareness.

A weighbridge, by nature, is very unlikely to be the tallest structure in its locality and so will rarely be directly struck by lightning. If it does receive a direct hit then no weighbridge in the world could withstand the electrical energy that would strike it and then pass through its load cells as the easiest route to earth.\nShering approach the problem of lightning protection from the point of view of preventing damage from this dissipated energy. We do this by using a PATENTED loadcell assembly unit which fits an insulating component between the ground and the weighbridge deck. The dielectric properties of this insulator are such that it will restrict the voltage potential across the weighbridge and its load cells to less than 100V, which is the level the load cells can comfortably withstand without damage.\n>Over 10 years of use on Shering weighbridges around the World has proved this insulator to be both electrically durable and structurally strong enough in the most arduous conditions.\n\nThank you for giving Eagle Weighing Systems Ltd \u00a0the privilege to serve you\nFor any further inquiries, mail or contact us\nAddress: Wandegeya University Plaza Room A18\nFor orders and deliveries please contact us on :\u00a0+256 (0) 700225423\n+256 (0) 787089315\nOr email us at;eagleweighingsystems@gmail.com"}, {"title": "Weighbridge shop in Uganda", "description": "Weighbridge The\u00a0C85 HSDS\u00a0is a high-resistance low-profile\u00a0above-ground\u00a0weighbridge, fitted with a single-block concrete platform, that is\u00a0designed to meet several or non-standard application requirements.\u00a0It is highly robust and adapts to major dimensions.\u00a0With a low-profile slab, its height remains low, which limits access\u00a0ramp lengths.

Eagle Weighing Systems has made both of them very robust and hence, the best available in the country.\nA truck to be weighed is directly driven to the platform of a weighbridge and hence, the platform is subjected to the entire load and vibrations created by a moving truck. Our weighbridge platforms (made of steel) are designed very carefully to withstand these loads without damage and is highly durable. The girders and plates used in our platform are selected very carefully and undergo stringent quality checks as per UNBS Grade.\nThe next most important component is the mounting assembly for load cells. This transfers the load from the platform to the load cells. This is a cradle assembly which is free to move in the horizontal axes and hence takes all side loads generated due to the vehicular movements on the platform. The mounting assembly consists of three parts namely, the Bottom Plate, Rocker assembly and Top Bracket.\nThe signal from the load cells (in milli-volt) is carried to the digitizer, in the control room, through a 4 - core shielded cable. The cable has a very low electrical resistance and hence, no loss of signals. The cables from different load cells, in a weighbridge, meets in weather proof junction box. The junction Box is of fully molded type and houses the necessary terminal blocks for interconnection of load cell out puts. The Junction box also carries a set of surge arrestors, to protect the entire system from lightning and electrical surges.\nThank you for giving Eagle Weighing Systems Ltd \u00a0the privilege to serve you\nFor any further inquiries, mail or contact us\nAddress: Wandegeya University Plaza Room A18\nFor orders and deliveries please contact us on :\u00a0+256 (0) 700225423\n+256 (0) 787089315\n\nOr email us at;eagleweighingsystems@gmail.com"}, {"title": "Anti-press, anti-aging and anti-rust weighbridges in Uganda", "description": "Concrete Platform Weighbridges :With ever-rising steel prices, it makes great economic sense to install concrete platform weighbridges. Apart from low costs, it offers high strength and is virtually maintenance free \u2013 requiring no painting every year. Its life is 100 years as compared to that of 15 years of a typical steel platform. Due to the advantages of concrete platforms, the developed world has been using them for over 30 years. In Europe 95% of electronic weigh bridges are made with concrete platform.\nAs the platform gets longer, cost saving increases. Modern day transportation is moving towards using longer trucks and trailers.The concrete platform weighbridge can bear heavier loads. That is why all modern bridges that one sees on the city roads are either concrete or composite.\nA heavily loaded truck entering the weigh bridge gives heavy jerks on braking. Vibration thus caused, reduces the life and accuracy of the load cell and thus needs to be reduced to minimum.

It has forged alliances with local sales partners in neighbouring countries.\nSILOXA\u2019s trademark is the development and production of innovative solutions with a high vertical range of manufacture, such as the gas cleaning system it installed in the Cologne-Rodenkirchen sewage works in 2000. Here, Stadtwerke K\u00f6ln (the infrastructure and services company of the City of Cologne) put into operation the first fuel-cell combined heat and power plant based on sewage gas in the whole of Europe, as part of an exhibition project. \u201cTotal cleaning\u201d with SILOXA technology made it possible to use fuel cells for the first time.\nAn example of a current innovation is the economy cooling system for biogas plants. With this cooling system, the biogas produced in the fermenter at a temperature of around 40\u00b0C is cooled down using ambient air alone. This process reduces the costs compared to conventional cooling units by up to 75 percent, because for just under half the year the outside temperature is colder than 11\u00b0C at our latitude and, in 91 percent of the hours in the year, it is less than 20\u00b0C. It is precisely this temperature pattern that makes the economy cooling system so successful.\nThe company was founded in 1998 and today, at our production plant in Essen, we manufacture products for increasing the efficiency of gas engines in biogas plants and other applications, with a high degree of vertical integration. More than 50 people \u2013 from engineers to trainees \u2013 work for SILOXA . All plant components are individually designed, manufactured and, if desired, installed.

The enterprise\u2019s ability to repair even the most extensively damaged or worn machinery soon attracted work from further afield.\nWhen the business expanded in 1958, Irvine Bell built a new workshop on his smallholding. Now joined by his brother Robert, brother-in-law Malcolm Campbell and with Eunice keeping the books, the small enterprise, I A Bell and Company, provided a general engineering service along with limited manufacturing of Irvine\u2019s various inventions.\nAmong them a self-loading sugar cane trailer and an overhead transfer crane for local farmers.\nWith the family home built alongside the workshops, sons Peter, Gary and Paul grew up amongst the welding sparks and machine shop swarf in a grease filled mechanical parts intensive environment.\nIn the early 1960\u2032s Irvine Bell saw a further opportunity to improve the sugar cane harvesting process. While a few rudimentary cane loading machines had appeared on the scene, most were adapted farm tractors and as such lacked manoeuvrability to quickly gather a load of cane.\nIrvine Bell\u2019s approach was to develop a whole new class of machine. Utilising emerging hydrostatic technology and borrowing hydraulic motors from an old motor grader, his prototype three wheeled loader was granted a patent and named the greatly manoeuvrable self propelled machine.\nAble to control each of the large drive wheels independently, the Bell Tri-Wheeler could turn instantly on its own axis. Also the simple control concept, was easily assimilated by operators without any previous machinery experience.\nChoosing to focus on the general engineering side of his business, Irvine Bell licensed the manufacture of his Cane Loader to a Johannesburg based locomotive company that was active in cane transport at the time.\nThe quest to design productive mobile machinery was not lost on his sons. Peter and Gary\u2019s first go-kart, scrounged together during school holidays, could pull a small tip trailer. And with a dozer blade fitted to the front of the cart to spread gravel, the rig was put to work repairing the dirt roads on the smallholding!\nBy the early 1970\u2032s the business had again expanded to a new facility in Empangeni\u2019s industrial area.\nWith the construction of a greenfields port in nearby Richards Bay, the Company provided many innovative engineering solutions to the port\u2019s contracting consortium. Among them light-weight, high flotation earthmoving dumper trailers that could cope with the soft sand conditions.\nNow with the next generation on board in the business, Irvine Bell, together with sons Peter and Gary developed and patented a cane cutting attachment that enabled the Tri-Wheeler to further mechanise cane harvesting.\nIrvine Bell was nevertheless wary of his son\u2019s ambition to venture into mass production, warning the boys that within a year they could lose interest after producing the same piece of machinery on a continuous basis.\nInstead, after a windfall maiden production year which saw fifty units produced, the Company was rising to the challenge of successful manufacturing. Applying practical hydrostatic systems experience gained while working on sabbatical with the Vickers distributor, Peter Bell made significant improvements to the Tri-Wheeler\u2019s design and in 1975, with the expiry of the manufacturing licence which had seen production being outsourced, Bell itself began production of complete machines.\nThe number of applications where the Tri-Wheeler could be used grew. Fitted with a forklift mast, the Rough Terrain Forklift version was quickly embraced by the country\u2019s brick industry. For the expanding timber industry, a log handling version was configured. Equipped with a log grab, the Bell Logger proved to be the ideal tool to gather logs and to load transporters.\nObserving the deficiencies in the adapted farm tractors used as transporters in the sugar and timber industries, Peter Bell conceptualised a more robust machine. Purpose built for haul work with a truck-style drivetrain, a steel chassis and tough earthmoving machine for construction, the Bell Rigid Tractor, together with a range of job matched trailers, found a ready market in cane and timber haulage which then expanded into earthmoving applications.\nNow working in the earthmoving industry, Peter Bell saw the opportunity to apply the hauler\u2019s strong simple design philosophy to the Front End Loader concept. He set about designing a tough \u2018Built-for-Africa\u2019 mid-size Wheeled Loader range that were destined to become market leaders in their class. After a few years of marketing their growing product range through independent distributors, the Company recognised the advantage of having its own dedicated outlets to provide customers with factory direct support. And so the Bell Customer Service Centre support network was born. Beginning with a branch in Johannesburg, Bell Equipment soon had national coverage and within a few years exports to neighbouring countries put Bell firmly on the map.\nBy the early 1980\u2032s with a factory staff of just over 100, the manufacturing operation had outgrown the Empangeni facility and in 1984 a new custom built factory located in Richards Bay was commissioned. By this time the Tri-Wheel Loader range had found ready markets abroad and the plant provided product in kit form to final assembly facilities in Mauritius which in turn supplied Cane Loaders locally and into Africa. A New Zealand assembly facility provided loaders for the Australasian forest industry. In the United States, the Company first partnered with a large forestry equipment manufacturer to build American versions of the Logger. Later Bell Equipment established its own facilities in the southern timber market to distribute products exported from the Richards Bay plant.\nAlso during the early 1980\u2032s a new configuration of earthmover arrived in the South African market place. These Articulated Dump Trucks imported from Europe were effective and versatile. Bell nevertheless saw room for improvement, fine tuning their design to better cope with the harsh operating conditions common in Africa.\nLaunched in 1985, Bell Equipment\u2019s first Articulated Dump Truck, the 25 ton model was a resounding success. This led to new models expanding the range. Lighter, faster models extended the artic truck application to a greater number of challenging hauls. By 1989, with the doubling of the Richards Bay plant capacity, the flagship 40 ton capacity Articulated Dump Truck was launched and our worldwide team of employees had grown to 1 650.\nToday the Bell Articulated Dump Truck range has again expanded, breaking new ground with the mining-focused 50 ton capacity B50D. To compliment its own product range, Bell Equipment has partnered with global equipment manufacturers to provide customers with a comprehensive range of machines in the construction, forestry, mining and agriculture industries. The group has a customer devoted distribution network that is proud of their service record.\nOur strategic partnership formed with one of the world\u2019s largest equipment manufacturers, the John Deere Company, during 1999 provides the financial strength to realise our goal \u2013 be the world\u2019s premium Articulated Dump Truck supplier, and in Africa the equipment brand of choice.\nBy partnering with customers and suppliers we have been able to grow from humble beginnings, where Irvine Bell from his tiny engineering works inspired the search for a better way."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/dexcom-solutions-ltd-24089", "id": "24089", "name": "Dexcom Solutions Ltd.", "description": "Dexcom Solutions Ltd. is an environmental, technology and engineering company.Nigeria offering a wide range of services and solutions primarily to the environmental and oil industries.

During that time, the West Texas sky was ablaze with natural gas flares, and much of the remaining gas was simply vented to the atmosphere. Beyond the obvious health problems this gas and smoke caused for residents, several deaths had occurred due to Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) poisoning. After experimenting with different metals that were immune to the corrosive powers of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), he developed the first vapor recovery unit (VRU).\nFrom these humble beginnings, HY-BON has grown from that basic vapor recovery unit (VRU) design to become one of the most well respected companies in the industry; specializing in gas management systems. The company focuses on a particular niche of the market \u2013 handling low pressure gas \u2013 and is a global leader in this arena. Capturing very low pressure gas is a true engineering challenge, and one that has taken the company across the globe and given it the opportunity to assist several industries.\nJim Woodcock, who acquired the company in 1981 and serves as Chairman of the Board, expanded the company to pursue methane gas escaping from any industry \u2013 ranging from landfills to breweries. For example,\u00a0HY-BON\u00a0equipment is used to operate Mexican breweries by capturing the methane fumes off fermenting beer and converting it into energy that runs the plants via gas driven generators. A HY-BON unit successfully draws methane gas from a wastewater treatment operation in New York, which is then used to power gas generators providing electricity for an entire neighborhood. In China, HY-BON units pull methane gas from petrochemical storage tanks in a large refinery. In a peach canning factory in California peelings are made into a sludge, heated and bacteria added to emit methane, which is then captured by HY-BON equipment and used to power the cannery.\nHY-BON, however, has not abandoned it\u2019s roots. The company remains the market leader on vapor recovery units (VRU's), and has expanded it\u2019s role in the oil and gas industry beyond vapor recovery to include gas booster systems, casinghead pressure reducing units, and a range of compressor packages focused on handling low pressure gas. HY-BON has been fortunate to provide vapor recovery units (VRU's) for the oil & gas industry in over twenty countries, both onshore and offshore, in an incredible range of applications. HY-BON vapor recovery units (VRU's) operate in most of the mature oil basins in the world, from Indonesia to Yemen.\nWhile still best known for our industry leading role in vapor recovery, HY-BON has been extremely successful in other low pressure applications as well. In the past 12 months HY-BON has provided casinghead gas reduction units and gas booster systems to over eighty different operators, including Chevron Texaco, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell Oil, British Petroleum, Hunt Oil, Apache, Devon, and Pure Resources. The casinghead reduction units are used to reduce the pressure on the wellbore, allowing oil to flow more freely. The gas booster systems are typically used to connect multiple wells and boost the gas pressure to allow entry into the pipeline. We have also been successful in the offshore market, with offshore packages currently operating for such companies as Kerr-McGee, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron Texaco.\nHY-BON has been honored to serve our customers over the past 50 years, and may the next 50 be equally as exciting!"}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/irt-consult-ltd-37980", "id": "37980", "name": "IRT Consult Ltd.", "description": "IRT Consult Ltd. provide VOC leak and emissions survey services to the Oil, Gas, Petrochemical, landfill and environmental monitoring industries.

These first padlocks were produced in a single room of a small commercial building, which consisted of a drill press, a grinder, a punch press and five employees.

Ironically, prohibition not only had a hand in the new production process, but also contributed to the majority of the first orders.

Customers needed an effective alternative to foam that was at least as effective and much easier to use.\nDuring the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s, formulations were tested and retested in cooperation with local fire departments and firefighting training academies in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Canada. Field testing was carried using numerous formulations in an effort to develop a single product that could be used to mitigate a wide range of fuels, including those with additives.\u00a0 Ron\u2019s chemical distribution company, Metra Chem began selling BioSolve to fire departments and emergency responders from the late 1970\u2019s and throughout the 1980\u2019s.\nIn the fall of 2009, Ron & Steve were approached by James Edgerly and Karl Loos regarding the sale of the BioSolve business. The two had worked together during the 1980\u2019s in the Chemical Industries practice at the management consulting firm, Arthur D.\u00a0 Little, Inc (Cambridge, MA).\nAfter strenuous and protracted negotiations, the sale of the BioSolve business was consummated in June of 2010.\u00a0 Sale of the BioSolve business allowed Ron to enjoy a brief retirement with his wife Sueyo and their beloved dog, Mark.\u00a0 The new owners established \u201cThe BioSolve Company\u201d and set up offices in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Pedrollo met businessmen and officials of the Arab country and explained to them that, thanks to pumps, Water could gush forth from the desert. One of the most important electric pump manufacturers in the world had been born, with a commitment that it has always stood by: the future of the Pedrollo company would be to collaborate on the solution to the water problem.\nPedrollo\u2019s market developed in just a few years: after Dubai the company made itself known throughout the Middle East. Then came Latin America, Africa... And then Bangladesh, where Silvano Pedrollo met a man who asked him to design\u00a0an inexpensive, low-consumption pump\u00a0that he would sell by the thousands. They built one that cost as much as a couple of pizzas and sent him enough of them for a province: peasants no longer had to depend on the rains, and that year the rice crop was more plentiful than it had ever been.\u00a0The value of water had become real, concrete, and since then water installations are considered a primary good.\nFor almost 40 years the Pedrollo group has been growing world-wide and continues to design and build pumps that help carry water where it is most needed.\u00a0Where water pours forth, colour returns to the landscape and hope springs anew. With each well the most parched lands recover vigour. In the same way, Pedrollo believes that to bear fruit,\u00a0solidarity is a commitment that has to be cultivated every day.

Requisites undoubtedly important from a commercial standpoint, and yet also simple expressions of\u00a0a loftier value that has always inspired the company\u2019s activities: respect for people.\nTo demonstrate the concreteness of this ethical orientation, Pedrollo has chosen to apply particularly advantageous terms of sale in the conviction that water isn\u2019t an ordinary merchandise to draw profit from but\u00a0a special resource that must be guaranteed to everyone. In this way the company tangibly manifests a form of sincere respect towards those most in need of solidarity and attention.   Pedrollo also designs and manufactures the best possible product in terms of efficiency, reliability and guaranteed originality: a result it strives for through the continuing commitment of its\u00a0research and development division.

Respect, therefore, is the true cornerstone of the Pedrollo philosophy: a deliberate choice that was already made at the time the company was formed in 1974, and that made it, nearly 40 years ahead of its time, a concrete example of a company attentive to social responsibility, an orientation that only now is beginning to spread."}, {"title": "Innovation", "description": "More and more, innovation is playing a leading role in the electric pump sector.

Corporation ('OI') was organized in 1963 in accordance with the Business Corporation Act of the State of Oklahoma under the name Clinical Development Corporation (CDC), a building contractor for medical and research enterprises. In 1969, CDC changed its name to Oceanography International Corporation ('OIC') and moved its headquarters to College Station where it changed its focus to oceanography equipment. This led to OIC's production of water-quality measurement instrumentation, as oceanography equipment sales declined. In 1969, O.I. Corporation developed the Company's first TOC analyzer. Since that time, the Company has become recognized worldwide as a provider of quality analytical instrumentation. The Company changed its name to O.I. Corporation in 1980.The Company acquired ALPKEM in 1992, Floyd Associates in 1994, CMS Research Corporation in 1994, Laboratory Automation, Inc. in 1995, and General Analysis Corporation in 1999. CMS Research Corporation continues to operate in Birmingham, Alabama as a wholly-owned subsidiary of O.I. Corporation. O.I. Corporation was acquired by ITT Corporation in November of 2010.On October 31, 2011, Xylem completed its spinoff from ITT Corporation, and began a new chapter as a leading global water technology company with operations in more than 150 countries; a passionate, talented, and experienced workforce; well-known industry-leading brands and water solution products, global 2010 revenues of $3.2 billion, and a shared commitment to making a difference in communities around the world.Xylem is comprised of four business units \u2014- Water Solutions, Flow Control, Analytics and Residential and Commercial Water.

After extensive attempts, he succeeded in melting two kilograms of platinum in an oxyhydrogen gas flame. The \u201cfirst German platinum melting house\u201d was born, and success was not far off. The young entrepreneur's customers soon included goldsmith shops and jewelry factories around the world, as well as dental factories, chemical laboratories, and companies in numerous other industrial sectors.

As evidenced by countless global summits, research projects and consistently accurate forecasts of climate change, the world leaders all agree that climate change is real. The question is how should \u201chuman structures\u201d respond.Across the world, response is typically divided into two interlinked components: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation describes the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimise the changes ahead. It will influence all organisations and individuals through the consequences of international agreements, carbon taxes, carbon trading and changes in the regulatory framework. Adaptation, on the other hand, is used to describe the fact that further climate change is inevitable and mankind would do well to prepare now for the climate of the future."}, {"title": "In practice most organisations will be influenced ...", "description": "In practice most organisations will be influenced by both the direct consequences of a changing climate (threats to water supply, supply chains and environmental deterioration as examples) and by the indirect consequences of mitigation agreements, regulations and social changes. A most visible issue surrounds carbon emissions standards and accordingly, GCAP, using its vast network, will develop strategic alliances with the world\u2019s leading carbon experts. The challenge for organisations in both the public and private sectors is to make investment decisions that are robust to both kinds of future changes. Adaptation in its broadest sense is the primary focus of GCAP.The recognised climate adaptation challenges support skyrocketing budgets of organizations worldwide. From the $1 billion currently available, a consensus forecast is $10 billion per year by 2015, and some experts believe the market will grow to $20 billion annually by 2020. The finances to support most climate adaptation projects at present are negotiated, controlled largely by politics. GCAP is well connected politically with all the major controlling organizations, including the Adaptation Fund Board, United Nations Convention on Climate Change Secretariat, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank and many of the national governments who are building early adaptation programmes.

At the time, Reverse Osmosis Desalination Systems were just becoming commercially feasible and available, yet only for large municipal plants. The President of Standard Communications, Donald Thomas, was a boating enthusiast, and after reading of this new technology to 'make water', he had the vision that this method of producing potable water could be used on small, individual systems for the boating industry. Back then the only means of producing potable water aboard a boat was to either catch rain or use bulky, unreliable and inefficient heat evaporation systems. Alternatively, boats had to carry water which inevitably ran out much too soon, and at inopportune times.  The boating industry owes its gratitude to Donald Thomas for his vision, direction, and leadership in presenting one of the most important innovations of this century to the boating world. Donald Thomas is the true pioneer of small scale Reverse Osmosis Desalinations Systems, and most favorably changed the boating industry over 29 years ago. Horizon Reverse Osmosis continues to operate with that pioneering, innovative spirit, and has evolved its product line into a unique style ideally suited for marine use. Horizon Reverse Osmosis continues today to hold a major share of the world market.  Sea Recovery Corporation obtained Horizon Reverse Osmosis in December of 1993, and today, Horizon Reverse Osmosis is a major product line of its mother company. The unique styling and separate distribution system that made Horizon Reverse Osmosis successful over the years are maintained and preserved today, and this allows Horizon Reverse Osmosis' uninhibited growth and development to continue its success as a highly regarded brand name in reverse osmosis desalination equipment.  The current Seafari line of marine watermakers enhances all that Horizon Reverse Osmosis stands for and has achieved in the water-making world.

Yet, unlike chlorine or salt chlorinator systems, e-clear generates no harmful chloramine gas or toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) providing a guaranteed superior swimming experience without any red eyes, allergies and asthma.\nFor domestic swimming pools e-clear offers home owners hours of healthy chlorine free swimming, hassle-free pool maintenance and a water wise, eco-friendly alternative to chlorine and salt chlorination.\nEasy and cost effective\nFully automated, easy to operate and maintain, with no corrosion to your pool pump, pool filter or pool lining, e-clear provides huge savings in pool maintenance and annual pool cost.\nA Proven Solution\nThis ensures healthy pool water and excellent air quality. E-clear is 100% effective against chlorine-resistant pathogens such as Legionella, Giardia and Cryptosporidium, ensuring that even at minimal chlorine levels pool water is effectively sanitized and compliant with SABS 241, BSI and WHO Health Standards."}, {"title": "How Our Systems Work", "description": "Using an advanced electrolysis process the e-clear oxygenator technology generates powerful natural oxidizers, hydroxyl (OH), atomic oxygen (O1), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen (O2) from the water molecule itself.\nDissolved oxygen in the pool is combined with copper ionization to provide a long lasting healthy and natural sanitizing residual in the water.\nSince e-clear oxidizers are more powerful than chlorine or ozone and since e-clear produces a sanitizing residual in the water e-clear pools do not require chlorine or other sanitizing chemicals.\nThe unique feature of e-clear is that swimmers are only exposed to the healthy sanitizing residuals \u2013 dissolved O2 and the copper ionization, since OH, O1 and H2O2 are produced within a sealed chamber away from the swimmer.\nThe powerful oxidizers, OH, O1 and H2O2, combined with O2 and copper, effectively inactivates algae, viruses, bacteria, yeast, fungi and protozoa.\nElectronic Oxidation\nThe Eclear 'stack' technology uses multiple titanium electrodes coated on both sides with a proprietary catalytic mix that include TiO2. Through the electrolysis of water (H2O) and an advanced oxidation process (AOP), high levels of reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH-) and other powerful Oxygen species are produced in a sealed 'Oxygen' chamber. Highly unstable and reverting back to water within milliseconds, OH- reactive species are the strongest oxidants that can be applied in water and acts unselectively and with a high kill-rate to destroy pathogens and other pollutants.\nThis AOP also produces high levels of Oxygen (O2) in the water which is stable and accumulates to saturation levels in the pool. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) acts as a healthy sanitising residual in the water to inactivate viruses, bacteria, moulds etc. and disinfect the water in a natural and beneficial way.\nStable Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Residual\nAlso produced within the sealed oxygen chamber, molecular Oxygen (O2) is stable and remains in the water. It is measured as Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in the swimming pool water.\nO2 is highly effective against waterborne pathogens, yet healthy and therapeutic for the bather. With high levels of oxygen the water is crystal clear, soft and healthy.\nIonization\nDeveloped by NASA in 1967 for the Apollo Space Program to provide safe drinking water, the e-clear oxygenator system also incorporates the ionization technology to provide a natural stable sanitizing residual in the water.\nMaintained at levels lower than that found in most food supplements and within EC drinking water standards, copper ions provide a long lasting and effective protection against bacteria, algae and most viruses.\nAn essential trace element for plants and animals, copper is excellent for hair growth and skin and provides a healthy alternative to chlorine.\nUltraviolet (UV)\nWith increased DO in the water, UV boosts the production of disinfecting OH and H2O2 molecules and is included in all e-clear drinking water systems, recommended for heated hydrotherapy pools and optional for swimming pools.\nThe e-clear technology is effective against E.coli, Coliforms, Enterococci, Pseudomonas, Giardia, viruses, algae and chlorine resistant organisms such as Legionella and Cryptosporidium."}, {"title": "Benefits of E-Clear", "description": "Healthy Oxygen rich, chemical free pool water\nE-clear's natural AOP produces saturated levels of Oxygen in the pool ensuring water remains crystal clear and pure, without the use of aggressive chemicals.\nOxygen rich water is healthy water. Oxygen not only destroys harmful viruses, bacteria, moulds, algae etc. in the water, but is highly beneficial, therapeutic and rejuvenating to the swimmer.\nUnlike chlorine, salt chlorination and ozone, e-clear does not produce harmful 'burning' oxidizers in contact with the swimmer.\nE-clear's advanced oxidation process (AOP) generates high levels of reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH-) in a sealed 'Oxygen' chamber away from the swimmer. Unstable and reverting back to water within milliseconds, OH- reactive species are the strongest oxidants that can be applied in water and ensure pool water is free from harmful pathogens, yet healthy to the swimmer at all times.\nE-clear's oxygen technology is combined with a low level of copper ionization, a proven algaecide and bactericide. The healthy and stable DO and copper ions provide a sanitizing residual that prevents any cross-contamination between swimmers and ensures that swimming pool water remains sanitized and algae free when pumps are not running.\nCopper is an essential micronutrient and highly beneficial at trace levels. So with e-clear you're swimming in healthy mineral water that is fit to drink and safe for family and pets.\nWith e-clear there is no \u201cburning effect\u201d and harmful 'bleach' in the water, so water remains soft and gentle.\nWith e-clear there are no chloramine gas so no red eyes, dried out skin, allergies and asthma and no disintegrating costumes. With no chloramine gas produced, e-clear pools are 100% odour free.\nUnlike chlorine and salt chlorination e-clear does not produce carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) or Trihalomethanes such as chloroform or bromoform.\nE-clear is the only pool treatment system that provides pool water that's healthy and 'fit to drink'.\nEco-friendly & Water Wise\nE-clear does not generate any greenhouse gases, chloramine gas, DBPs such as chloroform or bromoform, persistent organo-chlorine pollutants (POPs) or any chemicals that may harm the environment\nWith no chemicals or salt in the water, you can now back wash directly to your garden/irrigation saving precious water.\nWith e-clear you can back wash safely without polluting or causing any harmful salinification of natural water ways and wetlands.\nEfficient Sanitation\nE-Clear delivers more sanitation in 1 minute than any other salt, ozone, UV systems or chlorine can generate in 1 hour.\nE-clear oxidizers are more powerful than ozone, chlorine, salt chlorination or bromine and unlike UV and ozone provides a sanitizing residual in the water to prevent cross contamination between swimmers and sanitation when pumps are not running.\nBecause e-clear produces 100% natural non-selective oxidizers, it is effective against chlorine-resistant pathogens such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia cysts and Legionella.\nUnlike competitor systems e-clear systems do not switch between oxygen and ionization modes. With 100% oxidation output water remains efficiently sanitized at all times providing an excellent solution for large commercial pools.\nEasy to Maintain\nThe e-clear oxygenator is self-cleaning and has automated oxidation and ionization output ensuring your water is adequately sanitized at all times.\nE-clear systems are easy to operate and requires far less maintenance than chlorinated pools. Basic maintenance includes weekly back wash and pH check and keeping the pool clean and free from debris.\nOxidation plates do not require replacing (only cleaning once a year) and ionization plates need to be replaced approximately every 2-3 years.\nWith no harmful chlorine to handle, swimming pool maintenance becomes hassle free and safe.\nCost Effective\nWith huge savings on chemicals and water recycling e-clear offers the most cost effective water sanitation solution currently available.\nWith e-clear your water is soft and non-corrosive so your pool life is extended considerably providing long-term savings on pumps, filters and pool linings.\nEnergy Efficient\nE-clear uses a sophisticated microprocessor programmed to provide the best energy efficiency possible and as such it requires a far lower electrical draw than ultra-violet, salt chlorinators or ozonators. A domestic unit suitable for volumes up to 80,000L draws only 0.5Amp @ 220V whereas a commercial multichannel unit capable of sanitizing ~250,000L draws only 1 Amp @ 220V power.\nSince e-clear produces an effective sanitizing residual in the swimming pool, unlike UV and ozone systems, pumps do not have to run 24/7.\nGreat for Heated Pools\nE-clear is highly efficient when it comes to sanitizing heated water such as jacuzzis and swimming pools in hot climates.\nUnlike chlorine that becomes useless over 32\u00b0C, e-clear's powerful oxidation and ionization technologies provide a stable sanitizing residual at temperatures exceeding 36\u00b0C.\nE-clear's natural sanitizers are also not affected by sunlight and therefore do not require any chemical stabilizers."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/litostroj-power-48939", "id": "48939", "name": "Litostroj Power", "description": "The Litostroj Power Group includes several renowned European companies with a common base in tradition and experience and in know-how and development potential in manufacture of water turbines and hydro energy equipment.

Since environmental consultants use bailers to obtain water samples that are representative of an area\u2019s ground water, it is crucial that the bailers used in the field are free of any potential contaminants and held to the strictest quality standards possible.While it is up to regulatory agencies, environmental organizations and field technicians to establish and follow protocol for the retrieval of ground water samples, it is Aqua Bailers\u2019 obligation to manufacture a bailer that meets or exceeds standards for durability, reliability and most importantly, sample integrity.Vendor Selection. The manufacturers of Aqua Bailers\u2019 components (e.g., parts, tubes, balls, etc.) are as vital to a quality bailer as the cleaning and assembly processes followed by Aqua Bailers. Any variation in the size of a part (as little as a thousandth of an inch) can result in a leaky bailer, causing delays or compromised samples. Therefore, Aqua Bailers\u2019 vendors are held to the strictest manufacturing specifications possible.Material Selection. The selection of bailer component materials has a great impact on sample integrity as well as ease of use in the field. Aqua Bailers\u2019 components are only manufactured with approved, 100% virgin materials, such as FEP, HDPE and PVC.Cleaning/Drying/Assembling/Packaging. Proper and thorough cleaning of bailer components prior to assembly is critical to manufacturing a quality bailer; that\u2019s why personnel wear powder-free nitrile gloves at each stage of the assembly process. All bailer components are cleaned pre-assembly with laboratory-grade, phosphate-free detergent and given a final rinse with de-ionized water before drying. The cleaning, drying and assembly processes are performed in three separate pressure-positive rooms to minimize the possibility of airborne contaminants. After assembly, each bailer is individually sealed within 3 mm polyethylene bags prior to boxing. Every case of bailers and slow-emptying devices (a.k.a., VOC Tips) is labeled with a 6-character quality code. This code allows Aqua Bailers to trace a manufactured product back to the actual day of production to ensure correction of any component quality issues that may arise.\u2003Testing. Aqua Bailers\u2019 product standards are defined by superior field performance and superior sample integrity. Superior field performance is tested via destructive examination (DE) and non-destructive examination (NDE). Prior to packaging, assembled bailers are randomly and periodically tested to ensure they can withstand rigorous field use. Environmental consultants charged with the responsibility of analyzing ground water for contaminant levels as (minimal as parts per billion) need assurance that the equipment they use will not affect the sample. Optimizing sample integrity requires periodic independent laboratory testing of randomly selected assembled, pre-packaged bailers. Since each sampling event may be unique, no one laboratory test covers every consultant\u2019s individual requirements. For example, Test Method 8260B is appropriate when testing for trace levels of volatile organic compounds, but does not include metals. Aqua Bailers periodically tests its bailers to ensure a below-detection-limit (BDL) result for a wide range of analytes including, but not limited to, all RCRA Priority I Pollutants. Contact Aqua Bailers directly for specific third-party test results.Warranty. Aqua Bailers\u2019 warranty obligation is limited to non-conforming goods. Products to be examined, repaired, or replaced will be returned to Aqua Bailer at our discretion. Products are not to be returned, nor will they be received, without express permission from Aqua Bailers prior to returning. Contact the office for details on returning defective products.

It was a 12-inch capacity Model 100 Brush Bandit.\u00a0   That machine was built in a 6,000 square-foot converted repair shop, with the support of six employees.\u00a0Upon its completion, Mike embarked on a\u00a015,000-mile tour to market his creation, receiving his first order for five chippers in December of 1983.\u00a0Mike,\u00a0along with his wife and co-owner Dianne Morey,\u00a0launched the company in what seemed like a blink of an eye, and the cuddly raccoon decal on each machine soon became \u201cBandit\u201d\u2014 the well-known face of the company. Throughout Bandit headquarters in mid-Michigan you can see images of the famous raccoon in photographs, paintings, pictures and wood carvings, of which many are\u00a0gifts from dealers and customers as a token of appreciation for years of service, dedication and support.\nThe Bandit Campus: That first 6,000-square foot stand-alone building was soon eclipsed, with a company expansion taking places on average every two years to accommodate and facilitate growth.\u00a0That expansion still continues\u2013present manufacturing facilities exceed 280,000 square feet at two mid-Michigan locations, Millbrook and North Winn.\u00a0The\u00a0most recent expansion was completed in the spring of 2015 at the whole tree chipper manufacturing facility.\u00a0  Made in Michigan, Used World-Wide: Bandit Industries, Inc. is a full-line manufacturer of unique hand-fed and whole tree chippers, stump grinders, waste reduction Beast recycler units, high-powered forestry mowers and specialty equipment like the Model 60FM forestry mulch attachment for skid-steer loaders. All equipment is built at Bandit\u2019s mid-Michigan location near Mount Pleasant and is sold in over 50 countries, literally covering every portion of the globe.\nTalent: With each expansion, Bandit sought out and hired hardworking, local talent to keep growing in the right direction. Jerry Morey and Dennis Tracy joined the Bandit team in 1987, becoming part-owners with Mike and Dianne. With Dianne Morey serving as Bandit's human resources director, the company grew to over 200 employees in the late 1990s. That growth reached new heights in 2010, with the company's global workforce nearly doubling in the three years that followed. With Rosie Ebbinghaus\u00a0serving as HR director, Bandit currently employs approximately 500 people. Bandit's strength lies heavily in the quality and commitment of the employees, many of whom have been with the company for over 20\u00a0years and have grown with Bandit to become managers.  Whole Tree Chippers: In the early 1990s, Bandit introduced whole tree chippers for tree service and land clearing contractors. Through regular contact and feedback from customers, Bandit has continually led the whole tree chipping market for durability, reliability and performance. Disc and drum-style whole tree chippers are available with capacities up to 36 inches in diameter and over 1,000 horsepower, filling\u00a050-foot trailers with chips in as little as seven minutes. Innovations in chipper design, aggressive feed systems, and features like optional loaders or self-propelled undercarriages further make Bandit whole tree chippers the class leaders that so many companies appreciate.  Beast Horizontal Grinders / Recyclers: In 1995, the Beast entered the scene. These unique waste reduction machines have become extremely popular in the tree care, land clearing, municipal and recycling industries.\u00a0They are also ideally suited for biomass operations. The patented cuttermill system provides the ability to cut, split or grind waste material into valuable products, ranging from conventional wood chips to mulch, asphalt, and a unique product called Bio-Sawdust\u2014a \u00bc-inch minus material ideal for wood pellet production.\nStump Grinders: The first Bandit stump grinder was introduced in 2003 at the annual Tree Care Industry (TCI)\u00a0Expo.\u00a0\u00a0Available as towable units, self-propelled with wheels or high-flotation track crawlers, Bandit's comprehensive line of stump grinders are industry leaders for the tree care, rental and landscaping industries.\nForestry Mowers / Mulchers: Experience with stump grinders in the land clearing and site development markets led Bandit to develop a line of extremely capable, high-capacity track carriers. These versatile machines can wield either a large stump grinder head or a high-capacity forestry mower, all designed in-house by Bandit with the goal of providing high-power, high-production land clearing for forest thinning operations, pipeline and utility clearing, agricultural reclamation and much more. They are able to clear large areas in dense, difficult terrain.\nBiomass: Bandit Industries has long been a proponent and strong supporter of renewable, carbon-neutral biomass energy. Bandit continues to work closely with professionals in the biomass industry to develop whole tree chippers, Beast recyclers and other specialty equipment ideally suited for the production of biomass fuel. High-quality, specifically sized wood chips are vital for biomass boilers and fuel wood markets to achieve the highest levels of efficiency.\u00a0Bandit\u00a0is a global\u00a0industry leader in the production of\u00a0these specific materials, serving biomass operations from pellet mills to direct-fire biomass boilers large and small, all around the world.  Hand-Fed Brush Chippers: Bandit's claim to fame has been the hydraulic-feed hand-fed brush chipper. They form the backbone of more than 50,000 Bandit machines sold and in operation all around the world. With numerous styles and sizes to choose from, Bandit's comprehensive line of hand fed chippers favoured by companies large and small, from the local tree care specialist to landscapers, large scale land clearers and loggers.\u00a0   Dealer Network: Bandit simply has the best dealer network in the industry, with locations all around the world to serve customers directly. Bandit dealers provide valuable services and support to their customers on the front lines thanks to extensive factory training in both sales and service, ensuring that customers receive the best equipment and follow-up support possible. Recent company growth has seen this dealer network expand rapidly; since 2011 Bandit has added a new dealer nearly every month on average. There are currently over 160 Bandit dealer locations in over 50 countries.  Bandit Customers: In the end, Bandit's customers have remained the number one priority. 'We pride ourselves on the number of repeat customers who buy and rent our equipment,' said Bandit Industries President Jerry Morey. 'Listening to the ideas and suggestions of those who use our equipment has led to the development of many of our products. We consider our relationship with our customers a partnership.

However, the law regulating disaster recovery tasks does not lay down environmental quality and quantity requirements, although properly chosen recovery technology may considerably reduce the load on the environment.Another problematic area is that traditional, currently available fire fighting techniques such as the foam jet pipes, foam vessels, foam slides in case of semi-fixed extinguishing are not suitable for extinguishing with increased foam intensity, moreover their reliability is also very questionable and their potential failure will lead to a further disaster."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/rotork-plc-1909", "id": "1909", "name": "Rotork plc", "description": "Rotork is the market leading actuator manufacturer and flow control company that operates in any market where the flow of gases or liquids needs to be controlled.

In 1960, Professor Laukien set out to fill this need by establishing Bruker Physik-AG in Karlsruhe. Since there, Bruker has been developing groundbreaking analytical solutions."}, {"title": "History of Bruker", "description": "Around that time, laboratories in the US were already building the first high-resolution NMR systems for use in analytical chemistry.\u00a0 Prof. Laukien recognized the power in this technique and the need for an impulse spectrometer not yet produced commercially.\u00a0 He set out to fill this need by establishing his own company.\nDuring the 1960\u2019s, it became evident that to be a key player in the analytical instrument market, an increased global presence was needed with service and support for customers and researchers at a local level.\u00a0The first step in this direction had been made with the establishment of an office in North America, a growing center of NMR research.\u00a0 Despite the initial dominance of US-based companies, Bruker grew rapidly due to its technological superiority and its widespread acceptance within the NMR community.\u00a0Soon, Bruker SA was established in France, where facilities in Wissenbourg began to produce system components and sub-assemblies. The establishment of additional sales offices in Europe, including the UK and Italy, continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s.\u00a0In 1969, during the 25th anniversary of the discovery of EPR in Kazan Russia, Bruker announced further expansion into what was then the USSR. A new office was also established in Israel, further strengthening an already-established relationship with the Weizman Institute.\u00a0By 1972, Bruker\u2019s expansion had reached Australia, and in 1975 Bruker arrived in China, where a successful appearance at the Swiss Industrial Exhibition in Beijing resulted in the immediate sale of two WH 90 systems\u2014the first FT-only NMR spectrometers. South Korea and Taiwan sales offices soon followed, and in 1976 Bruker opened its first facility in Japan. Bruker was also successful in South America, with the first instrument installations taking place in Venezuela.\u00a0During this time of rapid global expansion, it became apparent that further growth in the market of analytical instrumentation would require the expansion into additional and new analytical technologies.\nBruker\u2019s already established strengths in NMR naturally led to developments in the field of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\u00a0 Bruker Medizintechnik (Medical) GmbH was formed in 1976, initially offering a range of mobile defibrillators.\u00a0 Later in the decade, Bruker had developed and was producing NMR-based tomography systems for use in clinical and pre-clinical applications, leading eventually to whole-body clinical MRI instrumentation.\nOver time, Bruker chose to shift its focus towards pre-clinical systems and became Bruker BioSpin MRI, the currently market leader in the field.\u00a0In 1977 \u201cDr. Franzen Analysentechnik\u201d was founded in Bremen as a spin-off company from Atlas MAT. A few years later, in 1980, Bruker acquired this company and renamed it \u201cBruker-Franzen Analytik\u201d, adding robust quadrupole mass spectrometers to the Bruker portfolio. That same year the first mobile detection system, the MM1, proved successful in both the civilian and military markets. In 1997 Bruker-Franzen Analytik GmbH was renamed Bruker Daltonik GmbH. The name was chosen to honor John Dalton for his work in formulating the theory of the atomic structure of matter. The development of two new ionization procedures in the late 1980s, electrospray and MALDI, enabled the ionization and analysis of biomolecules. This paved the way for the application of mass spectrometry in molecular biology and molecular medicine. With the spectrometers being continuously enhanced, Bruker mass spectrometry experienced unexpected growth.\u00a0In 1997 Bruker acquired the X-ray spectroscopy division of Siemens AG, which included prime manufacturing facilities in Karlsruhe and Madison, Wisconsin. Commercial growth, combined with additional company acquisitions, quickly launched Bruker AXS as a leading provider of X-ray analytical instrumentation, significantly extending Bruker\u2019s technology portfolio.\nUnification under a single parent company\u2014the Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ:\u00a0 BRKR) created one of the strongest brands in analytical instrumentation.\u00b4"}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/shivsu-canadian-clear-44278", "id": "44278", "name": "Shivsu Canadian Clear", "description": "Shivsu Canadian Clear is a single source manufacturer offering totally integrated water treatment solutions.

In the beginning its activities were focussed on the Canary Islands and south-east Spain, with occasional projects also being executed internationally.The company was taken over by the ACS Group in 2001, and was incorporated into the Cobra Group. Since then, Tedagua has become an international leader in the design, construction, operation, maintenance and engineering of desalination plants, systems for producing drinking water from brackish feedwater, and plants for recycling water from sewerage feedwater. The company is also a leader in the design and construction of plants for treating and reusing urban and industrial waste for electricity generation.Tedagua's has grown considerably in recent years and, with water treatment contracts in all five continents, it is now justifiably considered a world leader in the water treatment sector."}, {"title": "Our Essence", "description": "TEDAGUA believes that specialisation is the best way to provide an effective response to emerging needs in the water treatment and industrial solutions sectors. Specialisation enables us to guarantee the highest standards of quality and service in all our processes - from research into new solutions and project execution, to our after-sales service.In recent years, TEDAGUA has put an even greater emphasis on research and development of new technologies for the water sector, in order to find new ways to improve performance. A key result of our specialisation and R&D is that we are now clear leaders in the application of new technologies associated with the desalination of seawater and brackish water. What were once considered complex and expensive ways of obtaining treated water, are now efficient, reliable and cost effective processes. Our strengths in membrane technology for water treatment has meant we have been able to develop a broad range of new product lines that allow us to provide effective solutions for treating a wide variety of feedwater types. From modular and compact plants, characterised by the fact that they require little or practically no civil engineering work, to drinking water plants for large cities and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) which are designed to treat high flows with minimum operating costs, TEDAGUA can provide an efficient and reliable solution.Some good examples of this are the many small desalination plants executed for hotel complexes or small farms in the Canary Islands, the large sea water desalination plants of Escombreras in Spain or Skikda and Beni Saf in Algeria and tertiary treatment plants such as the WWTP in Altona (Melbourne, Australia) or the WWTP in Taboada in Lima (Peru), the largest in South America."}, {"title": "How We Operate", "description": "The design of each project is developed depending on the characteristics of the water to be treated and the water's intended purpose.

Ironically, prohibition not only had a hand in the new production process, but also contributed to the majority of the first orders. On February 20, 1928, a container of 147,600 padlocks was shipped to federal agents in New York City.

NB: If the contaminant has ingressed past a depth of 500mm it is recommended that the contaminant is removed and placed into wind rows or placed into long piles not exceeding a height of 500mm prior to implementing the AEBT program.Analytical MonitoringMonitor target contaminant concentration TPH, TP and nutrient concentrations such as ammonia-nitrogen, Ortho-phosphate soil pH by implementing the following monitoring program.Establish the benchmark by taking soil samples of the contaminated area prior to implementing the AEBT program.Commence the monitoring program 21 days after implementing the AEBT program and repeat every 21 days until acceptable levels have been achieved.NB:Take the soil samples at the points indicated on a diagram at a minimum level of 150mm, pack, mark and date the samples in a plastic bag or plastic container and forward to your or our laboratory for analysis. [250gm per soil sample]\nImplementing AEBTInitially spray OilGone HB over the contaminated area by mixing @ a ratio of 1 part OilGone HB to 10 parts water.Apply Organic SoilFix at a ratio of 4kg per cubic meter by applying it evenly over the contaminated area, till / dig in and thoroughly turn Organic SoilFix into the contaminated area and water well.After seven days apply OSFN Organic SoilFix Nutrient and thoroughly till and aerate the soil and water liberally.Tilling exposes the buried hydrocarbon mixture to the heat [photosynthesis] and leaves the soil aerated.Turn the soil and water well weekly.A moisture content between 30 and 49 percent of soil holding capacity should be maintained during the AEBT program.What is BIOREMEDIATION?Bioremediation is a natural process that uses micro-organisms to transform harmful substances into non-toxic carbon dioxide, water and fatty acids. There is an almost unlimited supply of information that supports the successful application of bioremediation for the clean up of contamination, backed by agency clean-up closure certification.Micro-organisms, like all living creatures, require nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphate, carbon, water and environment to grow and survive. When these conditions are present, some micro-organisms will break down organic contaminants as a source of carbon for energy and growth.We provide a combination of chemical, microbiological and process technology that is synergistic in eliminating contamination. In general, we use a biodegradable chemical application to disperse the contamination into very small droplets. With this solution there are nutrients, water, enzymes and microbes. Since many of the better microbes used to consume petrochemical contamination are aerobic, we also add slow oxygen release agents to our solutions. Each of these additives plays a role in making our process work. By breaking the contamination into small droplets we create an exponentially greater surface area for the microbes to have access to the contamination. Around each droplet is a life support environment for the microbes to flourish, which consists of water and nutrients. The enzymes present break the contamination down so that the microbes can consume the carbon. This is very similar to the metabolic process used by humans to break down fats, sugars and other food substances.This process results in the contamination being metabolised by the microbes into harmless carbon dioxide and water. When the food source is depleted the microbes die off and the contaminated site is returned to its pre-contaminated state. All of our solutions, including microbes are non-pathogenic, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and biodegradable.Bioremediation ExplainedOver long periods of time and without human intervention, nature eliminates both natural and most man made pollution. This happens as naturally occurring micro-organisms, enzymes, chemicals and weather combine to eliminate toxins. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to greatly accelerate these natural processes by selecting, concentrating and acclimating micro organisms to attack and eliminate many hydrocarbon based toxic materials in a matter of weeks rather than decades. The use of these micro-organisms to consume and eliminate dangerous or unwanted hydrocarbon based contaminants like petroleum products is called bioremediation. Bioremediation can achieve the elimination of contamination in many environments with a speed and thoroughness much greater than traditional methods and at significantly lower costs.The process is fundamentally simple. Contaminants like creosote, fuel oil, toluene, and even PCBs are composed of carbon chain molecules. Some of the most toxic hydrocarbon contaminants also contain chlorine. Although too complex or too toxic for most living organisms to metabolise, there are naturally occurring micro-organisms that can be cultured to attack these compounds. When these micro-organisms, along with materials that provide them with other requirements like oxygen, are put in contact with the contaminants, they attack the complex hydrocarbon molecules and break them down into harmless by-products. In the process the micro-organisms ultimately die, leaving nothing but harmless organic residues like any other micro-organisms leave behind.The versatility of this method of clean up is remarkable. In many cases bioremediation can be used without any significant site disruption. For example, hydrocarbon contamination in aquifers can often be treated by injecting the micro-organisms into the well where they follow the contaminant plume and reduce the contamination to harmless materials. In some cases oil contamination can be eliminated with topical applications. In other cases the micro-organisms may need to be introduced into the soils with mechanical assistance like deep ploughing of the soils. In the more extreme cases the contaminated soils may be put into large containers where they are treated with the organisms and then returned directly to the site.Unique application potentials also exist. For example, contamination under concrete slabs can be remediated by introducing the organisms with horizontal boring or through the slab borings. This can eliminate the need for removal of slabs or buildings as traditional clean up processes would require. The economics of bioremediation are almost always significantly more favourable than other techniques. The primary reason is that there is no need for the hauling and expensive disposal costs of contaminated soils.On sites where contamination is confined to clearly defined areas it can be possible to begin the development process on the clean areas while bioremediation is in progress on the remainder of the site. This is possible because the process is generally not very disruptive and does not require the removal and replacement of large amounts of soil. Furthermore, while conventional remediation often just moves the pollution from one place to another, bioremediation actually eliminates the unwanted materials. Bioremediation should be considered as an environmentally and economically desirable option for any site where hydrocarbon based remediation is required."}, {"title": "Mission Statement", "description": ""}, {"title": "How To Use", "description": "Procedures for using :\nProcedure for treating Oil Spills on SoilThe following procedure is to be used to treat surface spills on soil (up to a maximum ingress of 100mm).

High frequency design coupled with the MC class's improved piston / bit design gives significant penetration rate increases in all drilling conditions. The patented bit retention system gives a fully supported drill bit, which eliminates bit shanking above the chuck and provides a more reliable hammer. The extremely efficient air flow and exhaust system allows the MC range of hammers to drill through extremely large volumes of water without flooding out.\nEISEN Rockdrills' refurbish facility transforms used jumbos and surface drills into a brand-new condition at a fraction of the price of a new drill machine. By maintaining a complete inventory of parts, underground jumbo drills can be refurbished with new engines and ready to ship in 10 to 12 weeks - a considerably better lead time than the one-year delivery expected for a new drill. Both diesel hydraulic and diesel electric machines can also be refurbished. The jumbos are fitted with the EISEN Wolverine 4000 control panel and the EISEN Wolverine Class hydraulic system, which allows the operation of any manufacturers' hydraulic drills to be fitted and run at the OEM pressure settings. This is due to the EISEN upgraded power packs, which can be set to various operating pressures at the turn of a selector switch.\n\nHydraulic rockdrills and spare parts EISEN Rockdrills manufactures both new hydraulic rockdrills and spare parts to refurbish used rockdrills. The range of rock drills available includes many popular models from Tam rock and Atlas Copco.\nReverse circulation hammers EISEN personnel have a wealth of knowledge and experience in reverse circulation hammer design and manufacturing, spanning over 20 years in a drilling discipline that is just over 30 years old.

The question is how should \u201chuman structures\u201d respond.Across the world, response is typically divided into two interlinked components: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation describes the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimise the changes ahead. It will influence all organisations and individuals through the consequences of international agreements, carbon taxes, carbon trading and changes in the regulatory framework. Adaptation, on the other hand, is used to describe the fact that further climate change is inevitable and mankind would do well to prepare now for the climate of the future."}, {"title": "In practice most organisations will be influenced ...", "description": "In practice most organisations will be influenced by both the direct consequences of a changing climate (threats to water supply, supply chains and environmental deterioration as examples) and by the indirect consequences of mitigation agreements, regulations and social changes.

It has several different products that allow users to mix concentrated chemicals with other liquids, so the solution can be sprayed onto floors, windows, and other surfaces.\nThe company has grown fivefold since Dover bought it, thanks to a series of acquisitions and sales growth in Brazil and China, said\u00a0Jeff Rowe\u00a0Hydro Systems president. Rowe declined to reveal revenue for the company, but Dover Corp.\u2019s annual report indicates its fluid management division, which includes Hydro Systems, generated $1.6 billion in 2010 revenue, up 29 percent from 2009.\n10 immediate openings\nThe segment generated $388 million in earnings during the fiscal year. Dover reported net earnings of $700 million on total revenue of $7.1 billion in revenue in the 12 months ended Dec. 31.\nThe most recent transaction affecting Hydro Systems\u2019 growth was the January purchase of\u00a0Dosmatic Inc., a Texas-based manufacturer of chemical metering equipment used in the agriculture industry. Last June, Dover bought Chemilizer, a Florida-based manufacturer of volumetric dosing equipment used by animal breeders.\nRowe said the acquisitions accrue to Newtown\u2019s benefit because that\u2019s where the company\u2019s top engineers and financial staff reside. Hydro Systems\u2019 global headquarters is now looking to fill at least 10 positions and plans to create 75 to 80 jobs over the next eight years.\n\u201cWe were looking at a rental property in Milford and a number of other locations,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cIt\u2019s still a premium to stay and build versus move and rent, but we like being owners in this community.\u201d\nNewtown\u2019s tax credit allowed Hydro Systems to purchase a two-acre property next door to its Round Bottom Road facility. Rowe said the existing facility will be demolished. Hydro Systems will add 25,000 square feet to the 55,000-square-foot building already in place.\nThe current owner of the two-acre site, an affiliate of Campeon Roofing, declined to say where the 20-employee company will relocate. Mayor Cosby said he\u2019s hoping the answer is Newtown.\n\u201cThe owner has stated a desire to stay in Newtown if he possibly can,\u201d Cosby said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose anyone.\u201d"}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/geotextile-gabions-limited-45167", "id": "45167", "name": "Geotextile & Gabions Limited", "description": "We are basically erosion control and shore protection EXPERTS !

Since environmental consultants use bailers to obtain water samples that are representative of an area\u2019s ground water, it is crucial that the bailers used in the field are free of any potential contaminants and held to the strictest quality standards possible.While it is up to regulatory agencies, environmental organizations and field technicians to establish and follow protocol for the retrieval of ground water samples, it is Aqua Bailers\u2019 obligation to manufacture a bailer that meets or exceeds standards for durability, reliability and most importantly, sample integrity.Vendor Selection. The manufacturers of Aqua Bailers\u2019 components (e.g., parts, tubes, balls, etc.) are as vital to a quality bailer as the cleaning and assembly processes followed by Aqua Bailers. Any variation in the size of a part (as little as a thousandth of an inch) can result in a leaky bailer, causing delays or compromised samples. Therefore, Aqua Bailers\u2019 vendors are held to the strictest manufacturing specifications possible.Material Selection. The selection of bailer component materials has a great impact on sample integrity as well as ease of use in the field. Aqua Bailers\u2019 components are only manufactured with approved, 100% virgin materials, such as FEP, HDPE and PVC.Cleaning/Drying/Assembling/Packaging. Proper and thorough cleaning of bailer components prior to assembly is critical to manufacturing a quality bailer; that\u2019s why personnel wear powder-free nitrile gloves at each stage of the assembly process. All bailer components are cleaned pre-assembly with laboratory-grade, phosphate-free detergent and given a final rinse with de-ionized water before drying. The cleaning, drying and assembly processes are performed in three separate pressure-positive rooms to minimize the possibility of airborne contaminants. After assembly, each bailer is individually sealed within 3 mm polyethylene bags prior to boxing. Every case of bailers and slow-emptying devices (a.k.a., VOC Tips) is labeled with a 6-character quality code. This code allows Aqua Bailers to trace a manufactured product back to the actual day of production to ensure correction of any component quality issues that may arise.\u2003Testing. Aqua Bailers\u2019 product standards are defined by superior field performance and superior sample integrity. Superior field performance is tested via destructive examination (DE) and non-destructive examination (NDE). Prior to packaging, assembled bailers are randomly and periodically tested to ensure they can withstand rigorous field use. Environmental consultants charged with the responsibility of analyzing ground water for contaminant levels as (minimal as parts per billion) need assurance that the equipment they use will not affect the sample. Optimizing sample integrity requires periodic independent laboratory testing of randomly selected assembled, pre-packaged bailers. Since each sampling event may be unique, no one laboratory test covers every consultant\u2019s individual requirements. For example, Test Method 8260B is appropriate when testing for trace levels of volatile organic compounds, but does not include metals. Aqua Bailers periodically tests its bailers to ensure a below-detection-limit (BDL) result for a wide range of analytes including, but not limited to, all RCRA Priority I Pollutants. Contact Aqua Bailers directly for specific third-party test results.Warranty. Aqua Bailers\u2019 warranty obligation is limited to non-conforming goods. Products to be examined, repaired, or replaced will be returned to Aqua Bailer at our discretion. Products are not to be returned, nor will they be received, without express permission from Aqua Bailers prior to returning. Contact the office for details on returning defective products.

This activity continued until the end of the Sixties.  And then... the turning point. From that moment on, the company management decided to differentiate the production by manufacturing tanks for other specific sectors as agricultural, quarry and construction. When the M.D. was issued on 19/3/90 obliging the manufacturers of tanks for the liquid storage to homologate their production, our company definitely chose the quality path.  Today, the distribution chain - based on the work of sole agents and resellers covering most of the Italian regions - is supported by the commitment of the Company. This provides its collaborators a constant updating and an efficient servicing, also thanks to a spare part warehouse able to provide a quick, well-run after-sale service."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/oil-dissolver-gmbh-62309", "id": "62309", "name": "Oil Dissolver GmbH", "description": "Oil Dissolver has proved that there is a satisfactory resolution.

However, the law regulating disaster recovery tasks does not lay down environmental quality and quantity requirements, although properly chosen recovery technology may considerably reduce the load on the environment.Another problematic area is that traditional, currently available fire fighting techniques such as the foam jet pipes, foam vessels, foam slides in case of semi-fixed extinguishing are not suitable for extinguishing with increased foam intensity, moreover their reliability is also very questionable and their potential failure will lead to a further disaster."}]}, {"link": "https://www.environmental-expert.com/companies/rotork-plc-1909", "id": "1909", "name": "Rotork plc", "description": "Rotork is the market leading actuator manufacturer and flow control company that operates in any market where the flow of gases or liquids needs to be controlled.
